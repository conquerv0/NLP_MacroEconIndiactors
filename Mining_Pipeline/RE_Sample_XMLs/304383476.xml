This paper argues that competing black political projects made "symbolic citizenship" claims: how social movements create the normative ideas of good citizenship they claim to represent by fashioning styles of political rhetoric, civic practice, bodily posture and affective self-mastery. Based on archival research of primary source text (training manuals, organizing pamphlets, minutes to meetings, speeches/writings) and discursive and comparative methods, this paper uses the two dominant civil rights political projects, the rights and black nationalist projects, as empirical cases to distinguish a set of historically embedded categories of black political practice. On the one hand, the rights project appealed to the idea of good American citizenship and used discourses of good black citizenship as a deracializing strategy to associate blacks with idealized American citizenship. On the other hand, the black nationalist project rejected universalistic claims of good America citizenship and used discourses of black authenticity to produce an idea of an racially pure, or authentic black political agent, in opposition to ideas of whiteness and deracializing strategies. Rather than produce a set of ethical practices that attached the black self with American nationhood, the black nationalists shaped a set of ethical practices to secure control of and govern all black communities. Based on their different symbolic citizenship strategies and understandings of American citizenship, this dissertation analyzes how the competing projects produced an competing ideals of good black citizens and authentic black citizens, evidenced in how they differed in (1) directing their political practice at the national or local level for continued reform, (2) how each political project organized movement programs and 'measured' black citizenship, (3) the pedagogical techniques that instructed blacks how to master personal, social and civic ethics, and (4) how they approached economic reform and urban revitalization. The legacy of the political projects normative claims on contemporary representations of black citizenship have bifurcated black political practice that demands techniques of deracialized self to integrate on a national level, while local representations of authentic black citizenship are anchored to the margins. The contemporary implications represent how understandings of citizens continue to be an important, yet overlooked, aspect of how social movements and minority groups makes claims for civic inclusion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</AbsText>

ABSTRACT
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Despite the numerous scholarly interest and research on the American black civil rights movement, there is a lack of research and understanding on how they approached citizenship. This paper argues that competing black political projects made "symbolic citizenship" claims: how social movements create the normative ideas of good citizenship they claim to represent by fashioning styles of political rhetoric, civic practice, bodily posture and affective self-mastery. Based on archival research of primary source text (training manuals, organizing pamphlets, minutes to meetings, speeches/writings) and discursive and comparative methods, this paper uses the two dominant civil rights political projects, the rights and black nationalist projects, as empirical cases to distinguish a set of historically embedded categories of black political practice. On the one hand, the rights project appealed to the idea of good American citizenship and used discourses of good black citizenship as a deracializing strategy to associate blacks with idealized American citizenship. On the other hand, the black nationalist project rejected universalistic claims of good America citizenship and used discourses of black authenticity to produce an idea of an racially pure, or authentic black political agent, in opposition to ideas of whiteness and deracializing strategies. Rather than produce a set of ethical practices that attached the black self with American nationhood, the black nationalists shaped a set of ethical practices to secure control of and govern all black communities. Based on their different symbolic citizenship strategies and understandings of American citizenship, this dissertation analyzes how the competing projects produced an competing ideals of good black citizens and authentic black citizens, evidenced in how they differed in 1) directing their political practice at the national or local level for continued reform, 2) how each political project organized movement programs and 'measured' black citizenship, 3) the pedagogical techniques that instructed blacks how to master personal, social and civic ethics, and 4) how they approached economic reform and urban revitalization. The legacy of the political projects normative claims on contemporary representations of black citizenship have bifurcated black political practice that demands techniques of deracialized self to integrate on a national level, while local representations of authentic black citizenship are anchored to the margins. The contemporary implications represent how understandings of citizens continue to be an important, yet overlooked, aspect of how social movements and minority groups makes claims for civic inclusion.

CHAPTER 1: A CULTURAL SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW AND CRITIQUE OF THE BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS LITERATURE
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The 1965 Voting Rights Act, which provided black Americans with federal
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
protection from state techniques designed to restrict them from voting, was the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
final political right won in over a decade political struggle that started in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Montgomery, Alabama in December 1954.   Four years after the Voting Rights
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Act, the civil right had limited influence in American political culture.   Since the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
decline of the civil rights movement, it sociologists have studied the movement in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
order to understand how movements start, develop, decline, and form political
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
identities.    This dissertation uses past civil rights scholarship as a point of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
departure to consider how competing political project produced normative ideals
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
of political practice.   It is an analysis of how cultural forms of resistance shape
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the body politic.  My use of the concept "political project" refers to the normative
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
ideas, discourses, narratives, practices, and forms of knowledge produced by
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
historically embedded political ideas of how political life should be, and how it
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
should operate.    In contrast, I define "social movements" as a collection of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
heterogeneous political agents temporarily bounded together by the political
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
projects normative ideas.  A political project provides a social movement with a
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
language to produce the ideas they claim only to represent while making claims
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
for equality, rights, freedom etc. By distinguishing the social movement from the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
larger political projects, I propose that social movements are not autonomous
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
from the larger political project, and that social movements are the historically
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
situated manifestation of political projects.
&lt;/p&gt;

This dissertation argues that competing political projects in the civil rights movement, a rights political project and a black nationalist political project, used competing discourses to make 'symbolic citizenship' claims. By symbolic citizenship, I am referring to how social movements define and create the representations of those on the margins they claimed to represent, subsequently producing the historically situated normative political agents. The rights political project used discourses of good black citizenship as a deracializing strategy to associate blacks with an idealized American citizenship. This included training the body to master a set of ethical practices, which limited affective outburst and the use of violence, which produced an idea of a good black citizen. In contrast, the black nationalist political project used discourses of black authenticity to produce an idea of an racially pure, or real black citizens, in opposition to ideas of whiteness and deracializing strategies. Rather than produce a set of ethical practices that attached the black self with American nationhood, the black nationalist project created an idea of an authentic revolutionary black agent attached to the racial group. Thus, the differences in how each project approached citizenship reflect the differences in liberal understandings of citizenship that defines citizenship as the property of autonomous individuals, and multicultural understandings of citizenship that critiques universalizing ideals of citizenship in favor of defining citizenship as the property of social groups.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The rights political project had a history in black American political culture. On the one hand, modern black civic practice begins to take shape in new deal political culture.    The idea behind the new deal was to expand the federal

              &lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
government role in providing economic stability through social services aimed at the American poor and working class. Situated in the 'great depression', pro-new dealers were responsible for passing America's first social security and minimum wage acts. On the other hand, America was in the midst of a changing political culture, as the Americans and Russians were entering to the 'cold war', and former colonial powers declined. Changes in postwar democratic culture, in part, created openings to reconsider the question of who and what counts as American citizenship. Blacks felt that the privileges of American citizenship should no longer be based on race in light of domestic and global developments. The development of the rights project produced new forms of civic practice. 1940's black activists Bayard Rustin, A. Phillip Randolph and E. D. Nixon introduced strategies of boycott, marches and ideas of nonviolence to black protest a decade before Martin Luther King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). More importantly, the idea of using nonviolent civic practices a shift in black political thought. Prior to the 1940s, debates between Booker T. Washington's vocational training W.E.B. Dubois's talented tenth, and to an extent Marcus Garvey's back to Africa Movement, guided black political struggle. The struggle for racial equally was generally sought through increased black economic standing. While not abandoning ideas of economic achievement, Rustin and Randolph introduced ideas of mastering affective responses and civic inclusion strategies. For example, in two essays published in 1942, titled "Nonviolence vs. Jim Crow" and "The Negro and Nonviolence", Bayard Rustin argued that nonviolence was a way for blacks to overcome the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
fear of whites. Challenging legal approaches of the NAACP, he noted, "Those who argue for an extended educational plan are not wrong, but there must be a plan for facing immediate conflicts" (Rustin [1942] 1971:11). The Rustin text illustrated how the black movement began to consider black affective responses to whites, especially fear and anger, which jeopardized the effectiveness of black civic practice. A. Phillip Randolph's March on Washington Movement considered explicit cultural forms of non-violent practices to challenge Jim Crow laws and racial inequality. Randolph portrays blacks as non-violent and willing driven by ideas of civic reform and equality rather than revolution. Noting the movement must be all black, but not anti-white, he argues it will "It helps to break down the slave psychology and inferiority complex in Negroes which comes and is nourished with Negroes relying on white people for direction and support" ([1942] 2002: 57). Rustin and Randolph provided blacks with an alternative to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) rejection of direct action in favor of legal and juridical battles to for constitutional amendments to end segregation.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The black civil rights movement emerged as a national political force during the Montgomery bus boycott. Although not the first bus boycott protesting segregation, it did capture the American, and worlds, attention with their ideas of good citizenship and nonviolent civic practice. Under the leadership of Martin Luther King Jr., the civil rights movement used discourses of good black citizenship as a deracializing strategy that sought to associate blacks with idealized American citizenship.    No longer concerned solely with issues of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
4
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
economic equality, King in particular begins to ask the question of what counts as good American citizenship. Nonviolent civic practice would guide black civic practices through bus desegregation struggles in Montgomery and the sit-ins and freedom rides throughout the south. Additionally, it influenced how direct action operated in the Birmingham and Selma campaigns for civil and political rights, Chicago and the 'Poor Peoples Campaign' for expanding economic rights for blacks and poor whites. However, the idea of nonviolence was more than a framing strategy or a collective action repertoire on how to protest. Thus, nonviolent civic practice was one ethical practice used to make symbolic citizenship claims that blacks are good citizens deserving of rights. It associated blacks with an idealized American citizenship, and challenged the broader civic polity to consider the role of violence in preventing minority rights.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Despite dominating 1960s public discourse on racial equality, the black nationalist political project challenged the rights political project, producing its own normative ideal of black citizenship in relation to whiteness and deracializing strategies. In contrast to the rights political project, the black nationalist project produced a set of ethical practices that attached the black self to the racial group rather than the nation-state. This included adopting self-defense and revolutionary practices in favor of non-violence and civic reform practices. The normative ideal of the authentic black political agent is represented in the text of Malcolm X. Malcolm drew from ideals of Garveyism and violent African post-colonial struggles of independence, and assumptions about ethnic white communities and the 'American Dream'.    During the Selma movement, the

              &lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) began using discourses of black authenticity to reject deracializing and nonviolent practices, causing a split within the movement. Blacks associated with the black nationalist project rejected the idea of blacks as individual good citizens struggling for racial equality in favor of emphasizing the blacks, as a racial group, in a struggle for power. After the Selma movement and 1965 Voting Rights Act, the normative ideals produced by the rights political project and black nationalist political project competed for influence in subsequent black political struggles.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The point of this first chapter is to review the theoretical and empirical research on the black civil rights movement. It will provide a context for understanding the conceptual arguments and limitations associated with social movement theory and the civil rights movement. After discussing the movement literature, I present my argument on how a symbolic citizenship allows us to understand the movement in terms other than social structure, state and/or organizational reductionism. Following the cultural turn in social movement research, my argument is that the black movement established a set of competing ethical civic practices, organized around shaping bodily demeanors, which produced two normative ideals of a black political agent. CONSIDERATIONS OF THE BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT LITERATURE
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The civil rights movement has been a benchmark case in the study of social movements and social movement theory. Scholars across academic disciplines generally focus on three empirical research questions. These questions also reflect the major theoretical debates within the civil rights literature
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
6
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
over the role of organizations, economic and political structures, 'intermediate' social processes like framing, and the cultural turn in social movement theory.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The first research question is how the black civil rights movement organizes activities and mobilizes supporters? By focusing on the role of organizations, sociologists have explained the movement in terms of the presence and readiness of social movement organizations (SMOs). The question of organization been centered on three sub-debates. First, were black organizations necessary to produce large scale social change? The debate is centered on how organizations centralized, controlled and produced the necessary resources (money, leadership, expertise, office space) for a movement to succeed. The analytical focus on black organizations has been used to analyze the extent of northern white liberal influence/control.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The second organizational debate is how organizations 'professionalize' black political actions. Professionalizing black politics is conceptualized as how much and where the organizations obtained resources. For instance, analyzing where SMO'a obtain external funding and support came is used to explain how some organizations had access to political channels and elites without using direct action. Specifically, SCLC and the NAACP are credited with professionalizing black protest, which gave them access to the dominant American political culture and public sphere. Although SNCC was considered more 'radical' than SCLC, SNCC's style of creating leaders from below also professionalized black protest.   Mississippi's blacks involved with SNCC were
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
7
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
more likely to secure federal funds for community development than black communities not involved with the movement (Andrews 2001).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The third sub-organizational debate is the extent of SCLC's bureaucratic structuring versus SNCC's grassroots structuring can provide a causal model for the effectiveness of movement strategy and outcomes. By bureaucratic, I am referring to how SCLC represented an SMO/advocacy group model that solicited money from members who are not directly involved in the movement. In contrast, SNCC represented a voluntary organization whose 'success' depended on the quality and quantity of its members labor and commitment. This debate highlights the relationship between organizations and ideology. That is, does organizational ideology determine decision-making or does the local culture determine the organizational form and ideology. In addition to ideology, different structures are said to create different types of leadership. SCLC and SNCC differed both on the role of leaders and how they recruited them. SCLC drew heavily from the minister ranks of the black church. SNCC drew from black students who sought to create leaders from the general black public.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The second research question is how the black movement takes the specific form it does under King's leadership. The conceptual focus is how King links the black struggle to the broader American civic culture. Specifically, researchers analyze King's rhetorical skills, how he situates black claims in democratic and Christian 'frames', and his role in forming a black collective identity. The analysis of King's rhetorical skills focuses on the delivery style of his speeches and the use of narrative.   His use of religious narratives tied the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
8
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
civil rights movement with an idea that black struggle was part of a natural and divine inspired social progress. Structural approaches primarily look at the role of class and race in forming movement strategy. By distinguishing 'radical' from moderate 'factions' of the movement, scholars explained how whites supported moderate groups like SCLC at the expense of more radical ones like SNCC. White support made the moderate groups more influential in the broader public sphere. The framing perspective looks at how blacks framed their ideology and strategy in terms of democracy and Christianity, which resonated with broader American public values. Collective identity refers to how individuals share a real or imagined status, as expressed through symbols, ideals and rituals. Movements develop collective identities to distinguish the movement from an adverse other.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The final question is why and how the movement succeeded and declined when it did. The idea behind the black movements' decline is that the movement was unfinished and forced to prematurely decline due to the same structural changes that made it possible. Specific reasons vary. The most prominent explanation is the federal government's level of receptivity and support offered to blacks declined. King's anti-Vietnam war stance encouraged the Johnson administration to ignore the black community. Black organizational infighting between the 'big six' made for ineffective and divergent political strategy. A third reason was the movement switches its attention to the northern ghettos and slums rather than southern rural population. The north, it is argued, was governed by a more complex and subtle form of racial politics the movement was
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
9
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
not ready for. Cultural approaches note the decline of the movement coincides with the disintegration of the movement's unified collective identity. Once new black power identities begin to emerge, different forms of political strategy and action develop. Next I will trace the filiations of black civil rights scholarship, illustrating how the above debates are situated in divergent theoretical traditions. POLITICAL PROCESS THEORY AND THE BLACK MOVEMENT
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
I group three analytically distinct sociological approaches to studying the civil rights movement under the single heading of political process theory. The three approaches are resource mobilization, political opportunity structure and frame alignment. I group them together based on their common emphasis of the structural processes that provide the causal explanatory framework for why the black civil rights movement developed and was successful. While each theoretical aspect is analytically distinct, they represent a continuation of a single tradition and provide a consensus or 'strong program' for social movement scholarship. Mobilization
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The resource mobilization perspective takes shape as scholars were trying to account for the social power of money and economic relations. This included how social movements solicited money from various publics, and how movements used the money for training activists, office space and publishing movement literature. The emergence of resource mobilization should be read in relation to social psychological approaches which explained social movements in terms of an 'irrational social actor' reacting to a temporary disturbance in the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
10
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
social system (see McAdam 1999: 5-35 and Jasper 1997: 23-33). By focusing on the role of money and resources, early mobilization theorists hoped to further the argument that social movements were 'normal' and 'rational' avenues for political discontent.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The importance of resources in the black movement was tied into the question of organizations. McCarthy and Zald (1977) theorized that the 1960s and 1970s introduced a new type of professional Social Movement Organization (SMO). Old SMOs were voluntary organizations. They tended to be grassroots and relied on local memberships. New SMOs were professional, in that they consisted of a paid staff, outside leaders, and passive constituent participation. Resource mobilization scholars argued that the movement was only possible because of an influx of skills and money into the black community. Resources provided resource mobilization theorists with structural indicators they deemed necessary for blacks to politically mobilize. Federal policies created resources that provided economic opportunities for blacks. Although McCarthy and Zald did not apply their SMO model to any specific social group, they did note that the welfare state provided society with steady employment and access to higher education. Anthony Oberschall (1973) argued that the most important move by the American state was the Fair Employment Practice Commission (FEPC). FEPC created a new black 'middleclass' by opening federal jobs to blacks. This new black middle class, when coupled with financial support from the north, provided the financial base for forming and supporting movement organizations.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
11
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Thus the importance of organizations and resources in the black movement were a way of taking into account economic indicators.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Not all sociologists agreed the role of organizations were necessary or even beneficial for blacks. Arguably the most influential and controversial work over the role of organizations in social movements is Francis Scott Piven and Richard Cloward's (1977) Poor Peoples Movement. They theorized that organizations alone did not provide blacks with the means of staging a feasible social movement, and challenged the assumption that blacks benefited from developing large-scale political organizations. They noted that the black movements' biggest gains came early on in the movement, prior to forming SCLC and SNCC. In effect, the movement suffers from what Robert Michels identified as the 'iron law of oligarchy' - how leftist organizations become more conservative the larger and more bureaucratic the organization gets. Rather than organizations and resources, Piven and Cloward argue the black movement benefited from large-scale economic and political structural transformations that 'modernized' the south. Specifically, they pointed to the decline of the southern cotton industry and rise of more industrial manufacturing. Their theory on political and economic modernization provided the causal model for subsequent black strategy and behavior. This included how black migration to the north made blacks politically useful to democrats looking to offset defections of southern Democrats to the Republican Party. Echoing these claims, Jack Bloom (1987) elaborates their approach by arguing that political and economic modernization   changes  the   southern   class   structure,   which   subsequently
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
12
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
produced changes in race relations. The most significant change is the creation of a new white middle class that displaced the old southern white agrarian elites. Bloom argued that this new white middle class was more open to providing rights to blacks so as not to interfere with the South's industrialization. Political Opportunity Structures
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The theories on the opening and closing of political opportunities intertwined with changes in the state and the economy developed from the limitations of resource mobilization theory and the debate over organizations. Conceding that resource mobilization places too much emphasis on a movement's dependency for elites' money/funding to explain how movements develop, political opportunity structure theorists developed a conceptual model that incorporated economic structures, political structures, organizations, and frame alignment. Economic structures are unemployment rates and patterns of urban migration, which explained the decline of a southern agricultural economy and rise of southern industrialization. Political structures are the state and changing relationships between political elites, which would foster a political opening for blacks as a voting block. Organizations are deemed necessary for movements to centralize their resources, ideology, and readiness for political action. Frame alignment explains how the movement situated their inequality claims in democratic and Christian frames that resonate with the broader American civic culture in order to gain white support.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Black organizations become a primary explanatory variable with Aldon Morris's (1984) research on the role of the black church in the civil rights
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
13
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
movement. His research is the first to downplay the extent of northern white elite
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
influence in favor of emphasizing blacks' role in their struggle for civil rights.  His
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
theoretical criticized Piven and Cloward's claims that black organizations were
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
more of a detriment than an asset for blacks.  He noted that "implicit in the work
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
of a number of civil rights movement scholars, including Piven and Cloward and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Anthony Obershall, is the assumption that subordinate groups are usually without
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
organizational resources and skills" (Morris 1984: 76).   Morris argued that the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
reason for black's success was their ability to organize their "indigenous base"
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
independently of whites,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
it is within this indigenous base that the basic funding patterns, social resources, and organized masses are concentrated and activated for protest... internal organization was the critical factor that enabled the movement to gather momentum and endure in the face of state power and widespread repression (Morris 1984: xii).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Morris is critical of two prior claims made on the movement.   The first is that
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
northern white liberals directed and controlled the movement.    This claim is
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
based on the idea that northern whites were providing all the resources,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
especially money, to fund black protest efforts.    Second, Morris argued that
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
downplaying the role of the black church resulted from a poor understanding of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the church's role in producing black leaders and church's political influence over
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the black community.    Morris's study empirically challenges both claims by
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
showing  that money and  resources  overwhelmingly came from  the  black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
community, noting that "much of the 'outside' money was raised by black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
churches, [black] organizations, and [black] individuals in the North" (1984: 57).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Since black ministers did not work for whites, black churches provided space to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
14
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
develop leadership skills and a safe outlet to criticize white racism. Without the functions of the black church, Morris argued the movement would not have started or been able to sustain itself.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Furthermore, Morris argued that black organizations were important because they were primarily responsible for providing the movement's leadership and ideology. This made SCLC especially important because it was intertwined with the broader infrastructure of the black church. Morris argues SCLC "functioned as the decentralized arm of the mass-based church movement" (Morris 1984: xiii). For him, the black church provided the leadership, funding and 'institutionalized charisma' for the movement. The SCLC merely "supplied the political dimension that pulled churches directly into the movement and made it a dynamic force" (Morris 1984: 78). Leaders, then, enjoyed the association with charisma due to their positioning in the black church. This helped the movement gain political influence with blacks, in part, because the ministers had a ready-made and willing audience. Since black ministers were firmly situated at the top, SCLC could operate as umbrella organization made up of many smaller affiliates, with its president King at the top of it all. For Morris, then, situated and reduced the question of leaders, ideology and organization to the importance of black organizations.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Echoing Morris's claims on the importance of black organizations, McAdam argued that Piven and Cloward "base their pessimistic conclusion on a view that equates the development of movement organization with certain processes destructive of insurgency. The problem with their conclusion is in the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
15
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
inevitably they ascribe to these processes" (McAdam 1999: 54). Unlike Morris, McAdam claimed a synthesis of economic and political structures, organizations and a social psychological approach of 'cognitive changes' to explain the various aspects of the civil rights movement. McAdam attempted to find common ground to account for both black efforts and structural changes. For instance, he argued the decline of cotton based southern economy, when coupled with fewer European immigrants, spurred northern migration based on the dependency of black labor to undermine unions. This change in economic standing created a black North-South alliance that decreased southern oppression. This, in turn, provided money and time needed for the development of black organizations and the consolidation of black political power in parts of the North e.g. Harlem, Chicago.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Once a civil rights organization is in place, McAdam argued that the organizations importance is not just the leaders, but also the characteristics of the organization and its degree of 'organizational readiness.' That is, blacks were sufficiently organized and prepared to take advantage of political opportunities. By 1955, blacks enjoyed 'active' black churches and black colleges. The NAACP served as an avenue to express discontent. He argues that "by building the movement out of established institutions, insurgent leaders were able to recruit en masse along existing lines of interaction, thereby sparing themselves the much more difficult task of developing a membership from scratch" (McAdam 1999: 129). Once the organizations were established, blacks were able to take advantage of 1960s political opportunities.    For instance,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
16
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
blacks were perceived by democrats as a coveted voting block to offset post-war republican gains in the house under the Roosevelt administration, and cold war politics put a spotlight on the contradictions of racism and democracy. Subsequently, the closing of political opportunities after 1965 and the disintegration of interorganizational cooperation lead to the decline in the movement. Specifically, McAdam argued, "at root of the disintegration was a growing disagreement within insurgent ranks over the proper goals of the movement and the most effective means of attaining them" (McAdam 1999: 183).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Political process theory incorporated a cultural level to explain the 'subjective' aspects of the movement. McAdam originally considered the 'subjective' meaning of collective action with the idea of cognitive liberation - or how the movement understands itself as a movement. He argued, "before collective protest can get underway, people must collectively define their situation as unjust and subject to change through group action" (McAdam 1999: 51). However, McAdam (1996) abandoned cognitive liberation in favor of framing theories, in an attempt to account for culture and agency within the political process tradition.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The framing perspective developed around the idea that cognitive schemes are created to influence how activists and the larger pubic make sense of a social movement's collective action (Snow et al 1986, Snow &amp;amp; Benford 1988, 1992, Benford &amp;amp; Hunt 1992, Benford 1993, Benford &amp;amp; Snow 2000, Gamson 1988, 1992). Framing theorists argue that social movements use frames to provide a 'diagnosis' of the problem, a 'prognosis' or solution to the problem, and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
17
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
a 'rationale' for how to solve it. This helps, among other things, to distinguish a sense of "us against them" (McAdam, McCarthy and Zald 1996) and how collective action events take on different meanings as they are incorporated into existing frames (Ellingston 1995). The framing literature approached the civil rights movement as operating under a single "master frame". Snow and Benford (1992) defined a master frame as a foundational frame based on a common norm of society, which dictated movement goals, tactical innovation, and created successes and failures. They argud civil rights protesters, as well as other social movements of the 1960s, use 'rights' as the master frame. Regarding the civil rights movement, Snow and Benford argue "its master frame, as initially espoused by Martin Luther King Jr. and his associates, accented the principle of equal rights and opportunities regardless of ascribed characteristics and articulated it with the goal of integration through non-violent means" (1992: 145).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The framing process is incorporated into the study of structural changes to account for how movements create 'meaningful accounts' of their strategy and protest. McAdam argued that the potential for successful social change in the black movement depended on how it framed its actions. Opposed to the idea of a single democratic 'master frame' because of its emphasis on ideology at the expense of tactics, he argued that how King framed his speeches in Christian and democratic frames grounded "the movement in two ideational bedrocks of American culture" (McAdam 1996: 347). Christian and democratic frames explain King's assent to the dominant movement leader. McAdam says "Quite simply, no black leader had ever sounded like King before.    In his unique
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
18
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
blending of familiar Christian themes, conventional democratic theory, and the philosophy of non-violence, King brought an unusually compelling, yet accessible, frame to the struggle" (1996: 347). Thus, King's use of democratic and Christian frame as ideology and tactics provided a way for blacks to be included into the mainstream public sphere and take advantage of political opportunities.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
McAdam (1999) argued that the movement's decline resulted from the same structural processes that created its success - organizational readiness, a change in state/political structure, black's prospects for future success, and the response from external white groups. Up until Selma, the civil rights organizations were centralized under the leadership of King and the SCLC. However, the centralized leadership and interorganizational cooperation disintegrated over differences in goals, wasted resources, and fighting and arguing amongst one another. With voting rights legislation secured, the movement lacked any uniform goals to direct common political action. The federal response to the movement also changed. McAdam noted that white ethnics began leaving the Democratic Party for the Republican Party, who campaigned against race issues. On the strength of the 'white backlash' Nixon was elected in 1968, which caused Democrats began to 'devalue' the black vote. Changes in state support make blacks pessimistic and less willing to be engaged. Coupled with the race riots of the mid-60s, and white liberals withholding funding and support from SNCC and CORE, the movement found itself with few resources in the form of allies, money and volunteers.   Besides
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
19
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
changes in the state, McAdam (1996) argued the movement found it harder to frame their message of nonviolence in the north than in the south, which made the movement's mains strategy mute. SNCC, Black Power, and Political Process Theory
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Early sociological research on the black civil rights movement centered on the importance and contributions of the black church, King and SCLC on the movement. Other scholars working within the political process tradition extended their studies to SNCC in order to solidify and refine its basic theoretical prose. Rhoda Blumberg (1984) draws on political process theory to argue that 'environmental factors' like urbanization, economic and political changes shape whites 'moods' and black strategy. Specifically for blacks, she argues "It is no wonder then that black strategists have disagreed among themselves, as they continually reassessed the limits of what was possible" (Blumberg 1984: 3). To illustrate, she rejected the idea that the black church was as influential as Morris claimed. She argued that the same conditions that made segregation possible also necessitated the placing of black ministers into the dominant leadership position. King is the beneficiary of non-church based Montgomery activists like Rosa Parks and E.D. Nixon and CORE'S early protests. The main contribution of King's nonviolence was to "awaken a sense of moral shame in the opponent so that in the end there would be redemption and reconciliation" (Blumberg 1984: 46).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
After Montgomery, SCLC and King increasingly relied on the other actors to 'recharge' or reshape the struggle.    She described SNCC as a counter-
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
20
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
movement that "develops its own ideology and rationale, reconceptualizing the impending change as negative and destructive of long-cherished values" (1984: 56). The ideological shift in more militant tactics created political opportunities for the movement. Specifically, it showed that the federal government was more willing to support voter education drives and act on behalf of blacks when faced with violent local municipalities.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to the changing political structures that McAdam notes, Blumberg argued that King's declining popularity hurt the movement and the potential for further political opportunities. She isolated America's involvement in Vietnam and King's anti-war stances, the rise of black power and the urban riots as reducing King's political influence and popularity among whites. These factors represented "the interaction of internal factors with the movement's external environment was crucial in determining its demise" (Blumberg 1984: 164). Along with the disintegration of the civil rights organizations, the internal-external relationship changes black strategy. King's anti-war stance angered Lyndon Johnson, and alienated the movement from the Democratic Party's base. The rise of black power groups distanced the movement from its reform strategy to more nationalistic ones. Urban riots allowed whites to focus on 'law and order' issues in place of anti-poverty ones. Instead of social movements and direct action, 'mainstream' blacks chose to work through electoral politics, thus depriving the movement of its best leaders and strategists.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Herbert Haines (1984, 1988) also argued that other social process were responsible for the form the movement takes under King's leadership.    For
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
21
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Haines, the success of the civil rights movement was due, in part, to the rise of black power and black militancy - the 'radical flanks'. His contribution to the literature is to consider how the movement was shaped with struggles and interactions between different factions of the movement. Theoretically, he attempted to move the analysis away from the functions of black organizations, resources and political structures to a conceptual focus of personal motivations, psychological states of activists, and interorganizational processes that created black heterogeneity in the civil rights movement. This involved studying groups other than SCLC and SNCC and focus on 'radical movement ideology' of black power. Haines argued that black militants created 'turmoil', which "was indispensable to black progress because it enhanced the mainstream bargaining position" (1988: 2). SCLC was successful, in part, because they appeared less threatening to whites. Haines showed that the influence of black power in SNCC led to a disproportionate amount of governmental grants and money from private organizations to SCLC and NAACP. In contrast, unions, black churches and individuals generally gave money to all. In addition to changing what groups received money, Haines argued that black militants change the movement's tactics and goals. He claimed the rise of violence and declining relationship between the movement, the federal government and white coalitions were the result of a 'crisis of faith': "The crisis was related to both the effectiveness of nonviolent protest as the primary means for bringing about change and the nature of the changes required" (Haines 1988: 46).    Therefore, CORE and SNCC's
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
22
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
adoption of black power indicate psychological changes in the mood of blacks, ultimately leading to the movement's split and decline.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Subsequent political process research on black organizations sought to show how black organizations 'professionalized' black political claims. Jenkins and Eckert (1986) assess the impact of professionalizing black organizations on the movement outcomes. They find support in political process claims in that SMOs provided a secondary role to both social structure and the grassroots organizations like the black church. Therefore, there was little or no elite white control over the black movement. In contrast to Piven and Cloward, they viewed black SMOs like SCLC and NAACP as channeling black demands, goals and tactics into more specified targets. The long term impact of professionalizing the movement is seen in post-Selma efforts at lobbying and forming voting blocs with other leftist social groups.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Kenneth Andrews (1997, 2001, and 2004) refined the organizational focus of political process theory by considering how black organizations impact movement outcomes, and whether or not the degree of professionalizing an SMO impacted movement outcomes. In contrast to political process theorists like McAdam, he emphasizes the stability of the black organization and downplays the idea of interorganizational cooperation. Rather than focus on organizational structure, he suggested analyzing the 'movement infrastructure' (defined as organizations, resources and leadership) impact on political process. He claimed SNCC's strong local movement infrastructure in Mississippi during the civil rights movement helped shape future federal antipoverty programs and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
23
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
policy in Mississippi after the 1965 voting rights act. Mississippi was considered SNCC's 'territory' because of their extensive efforts culminating in the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP). Even though Mississippi was associated with the more radical factions of the movement, the infrastructure put in place by SNCC allowed blacks to continue to lobby and get access to resources made available by the "War on Poverty" programs. By showing that the organizational antithesis to SCLC had the same impact on securing federal funds and influencing state policy, Andrews illustrated that similar movement infrastructures makes SNCC an important SMO actor and not just a grassroots organization limited by divergent ideology.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
CULTURAL TURN IN SOCIAL MOVEMENT THEORY AND THE BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The cultural turn in social movement theory shifted the conceptual focus away from political opportunities to questions to how social movements struggle to change the dominant cultural meanings, or 'cultural codes', which form social hierarchies based on (Melucci 1996). The idea behind the cultural turn is 1) social movements attempt to change the cultural norms, values and beliefs assigned to practices that serve as exclusionary markers and 2) to account for how, and why, individuals struggle for the rights of members of groups they do not belong to (i.e. homeless advocacy) or organize around issues (environment, AIDS/HIV).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The cultural turn challenges two key assumptions of political process theory.    The first assumption is whether we can judge and analyze social
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
24
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
movements solely in terms of instrumental rationality and securing, or failing to secure, new rights. Based on the concept of collective identity, which explains how movements organize, why people join and why they choose certain tactics over others, the cultural tradition attempts to get away from emphasizing instrumental successes (e.g. question like who wins?) to consider other ways that social movements are meaningful. The second challenge is to the explanatory power of frame alignment and organizations. Rather, cultural approaches argue that organizations and strategies result from the movements' political culture, indicated by their collective identity, which is irreducible to organizational form or movement infrastructure. In contrast to the idea that movements frame their grievances, the cultural turn analyzes the narratives -how the movement tells stories involved in establishing a collective identity - to explain the movement's identity and form.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Ron Eyerman and Andrew Jamison's (1991, 1998) work on the civil rights movement illustrates the collective identity approach. Eyerman and Jamison considered how social movements are involved in knowledge producing activities, which makes movements part of the collective learning process. Social movements contribute new types of social knowledge, what they define as 'cognitive praxis' - knowledge formation through social action. Concerning identity, they argue for an approach that, "focuses upon the process of articulating a movement identity (cognitive praxis), on the actors taking part in this process (movement intellectuals), and on the contexts of articulation (political cultures and institutions)" (1991: 4). They argued that the civil rights movement's
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
25
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
cognitive praxis is found in the cosmological, technical, and organizational levels, as well as the rediscovery of black history. The cosmological level is the use of Christian beliefs of 'redemption' and 'reconciliation', as well as the use of democracy to affirm "American ideals of equality and democracy, claiming their rights to be included in the mainstream of American life" (Eyerman and Jamison 1991: 122). The technical level is the learned protest techniques of nonviolence. The technical dimension created the nonviolent aspects of the movement's identity: "the specific objects of opposition and, even more importantly, the tactics, the techniques of protest, by which those objects were opposed" (Eyerman and Jamison 1991: 123). The organizational dimension was the development of mass action. They argued that blacks began to adopt their identity and see themselves as a real and imagined 'we' through boycotts, mass church meetings, sit-ins and music.1 Together, these dimensions constituted the civil rights movement's unified collective identity.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Civil rights "movement intellectuals" created and held together the movements' cognitive praxis by articulating the movements' demands to the broader American public. According to Eyerman and Jamison, movement intellectuals "create their individual role at the same time as they create the movement, as new individual identities and a new collective identity take the form in the same interactive process" (Eyerman and Jamison 1991: 98). Social movements allow for the articulating existing identities and for making new identities.   Therefore, the importance of movement intellectuals is in how they
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
1 Also see Eyerman and Jamison 1998 for detailed analysis of the role of music and song in the movement
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
26
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
defined new collective identities to mobilize around.    Rather than just King,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Eyerman and Jamison noted there were many movement intellectuals involved in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SCLC, NAACP, SNCC and CORE.  What unified all four groups was the single
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
cognitive praxis that established the movements' collective identity. Furthermore,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
movement intellectuals defined the movements' collective identity in relation to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
an 'other'.    The other is a real social actor like the government or state.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Ultimately, Eyerman and Jamison argued, it is the cognitive dimension that
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
makes the movement unique and successful: "the civil rights movement reflected
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the shifting focus of consciousness from the material to the cultural as the driving
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
force in the cognitive praxis of social movements" (1991: 145).  Hence, a social
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
movement's collective identity is as conscious acknowledgement and articulation
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
of a mindset that created new social knowledge in the form of new identities.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In contrast to isolating problems in organizations, ideology and strategy,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the cultural turn in social movements has rethought why the civil rights movement
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
declined. Similar to McAdam, Eyerman and Jamison explained the decline of the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
movement in terms of what made the movement successful.  Rather than credit
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the alignment or misalignment of political opportunities, Eyerman and Jamison
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
pointed to the fracturing of the movement's unitary identity by rival movement
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
intellectuals,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The later 1960s witnessed the specialization of the dimensions by professional 'leaders', the emergence of extremist positions in the name of black power and black separatism, and the gradual dissolution of the movement's cognitive praxis into fragmented, partial practices of separate organizations (Eyerman and Jamison 1991: 124-125).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
27
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to rival movement intellectuals, the polarization of American political beliefs expedited the dissolution of the civil rights movement. The polarization, they argued, made it impossible for the civil rights movement to occupy a middle ground. King was assassinated. Stokely Carmichael's affiliation with SNCC became troublesome because he championed 'black armed defense'. Whites and the FBI deemed black power organizations as extremists and a threat to public safety. Hence, the fragmenting the movement's collective identity causes the movement to split then end.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Eyerman (2001) supplemented the cognitive function of the civil rights movements' knowledge producing activities with an analysis of how the movement differed on how they should remember slavery. This part of identity formation is the cognitive process of rediscovering black culture and history. Eyerman argued that the memory of slavery is always important for black collective identity. For blacks, slavery serves as a common origin in a common past that every black generation struggles with in their political struggles. How the civil rights movement remembered slavery was important because "socially constructed, historically rooted collective memory functions to create social solidarity in the present" (Eyerman 2001: 6). Eyerman argued that 'Africa' served as the material object that created memories of slavery for civil rights activist. Consistent with his cognitive approach, he focused on the stories, or narratives told by movement intellectuals, which created a collective identity from past historical accounts: "Within the narrative provided by this collective memory individual identities are shaped as experiential frameworks formed out of, as they
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
28
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
are embedded within, narratives of past, present and future" (Eyerman 2001: 6). For Eyerman, the radical wings of the movement 'reframed' tragic and redemptive narratives in relation to post-colonial Africa to create the black power identity. For instance, Stokely Carmichael used the African struggles to speak of the civil rights movement in terms 'white nationalism' and 'black liberation'. In contrast, King and the mainstream movement used progressive narratives to explain Africa as new symbol for freedom, which symbolized how America could also change.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Francesca Polletta (1998) also argued for the merits of narrative, in place of framing, to understand how the civil rights movement formed collective identities. Framing was developed to account for how movement's actions depend on and influence political structures. She rejected frame analysis for lacking a conceptualization of ideology, for having no interpretive role, no explanation on how frames are created or their staying power, and for conflating material and discursive resources (Polletta 1998, also see Steinberg 1998). Concerning the civil rights movement, Polletta argued that the framing argument does not offer an account of the "discursive processes that precede movement formation of movement organizations... [and] the interpretive processes occurring in oppositional subcultures and indigenous institutions, and occurring during initial episodes of collective action" (1998: 138). Therefore, stating that the civil rights movement took form because of how it framed the struggle tells us very little on how blacks became receptive to the ideas of nonviolence and reconciliation with whites.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
29
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Polletta switched the conceptual analysis from the mainstream movement
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
actors  and framing  to the  students  of SNCC  and  narratives  in  order to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
understand SNCC's contribution to the civil rights movements' collective identity.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
If framing theories were correct, then why would the students of SNCC 'frame'
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
their actions  in  terms  of spontaneity when  it would  make  them  appear
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
unorganized and irrational?     Rather, she argued that we have to understand
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SNCC as using a narrative of spontaneity because,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Spontaneity denoted independence from adult leadership, urgency, local initiative, and action by moral imperative rather than bureaucratic planning. Narratives of the sit-ins, told by many tellers, in more and less public settings, and in which spontaneity was a central theme, described student activists and potential activists to themselves and , in the process, helped to create the collective identity on behalf of which students took high risk action (Polletta 1998: 138).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The sit-ins created a new identity that distinguished the students from SCLC and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
King.   By 1960, King and SCLC were still basking in the glory of the success at
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Montgomery,   but  were   having   difficulty   mobilizing   other   southern   black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
communities. For this reason, the sit-in narrative allowed the students to become
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
part of, reenergize, and make a unique contribution to the movement.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Polletta extended the cultural turn to the question of organizations rethink
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the questions of organizations.  Focusing again on SNCC, she rejected the idea
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
that SNCC declined because of a lack of bureaucratic structure.  Polletta (2002,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
2005) argued that organizational structure and debates on when and how the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
organization formed is a mute point.   She argued how SNCCs organizational
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
form was the outcome of the 'symbolic resonance' with identity rather than
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
efficiency (or lack of) in a style of organization (Polletta 2002: 88-119).   She
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
30
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
argued that friendships and tutelage were not enough to sustain the commitment to participatory styles of organizing in light the rise in black militancy, and the lack of ideas concerning effective programs and strategies. Thus, it would be wrong to say Black Power arouse in SNCC because of specific leaders or organizational form. Participatory democracy became an identity, and once that identity was associated with being 'white', blacks began to argue for a more strict bureaucratic structure. Polletta rightly critiqued organizational scholars for eliminating culture and identity from there explanatory models. Once we consider the movement's political culture, the importance and centrality of organizations weakens. In a sense, the debate over the importance of organizations initiated by Piven and Cloward has come full circle. We have gone from models that question the relationship between organizations and movement outcomes, to models that overemphasized the importance of organizations structure, leaders and resources, to how political cultures informs organizing strategies.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Polletta questioned the idea that the movement declined because of the fragmentations of organizations, ideology or collective identity. She argued that the 'real' problem was "generating the sense of radical purpose that would reenergize organizers and appeal to residents" (2002: 102). This frustration became racially coded, for instance, in debates over the amount of whites involved and their roles as leaders. SNCC's frustration extended to rejecting participatory styles of democracy as white, and consequently, their adoption of a black power identity, "Participatory democracy came to be seen as white, and, in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
31
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
contrast, a centralized and top-down organizational structure came to symbolize not only programmatic certainty but also black orientation" (Polletta 2002: 90). However, the development of a black nationalist identity does not solve the problems of what to do, nor did it energize subsequent SNCC strategies. SYMBOLIC CITIZENSHIP, THE BODY AND THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Following the cultural sociology critiques of the existing civil rights literature, I will argue for the importance of "symbolic citizenship" for social movement research. By symbolic citizenship, I refer to the analysis of how social movements make discursive claims that they are good citizens worthy of citizenship rights. Past research on citizenship and social movements considered how citizenship rights resulted from transformations in state structure (Tilly 1995), the importance of active participation (Licterman 1996) and how new social movements primarily struggle for the rights of others (Jasper 1997, Waters 1998). In research on the black movement, citizenship has been read solely as a instrumental gain fixated on the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965 (Garrow 1978, 1986). Symbolic citizenship contributes to the existing citizenship and social movement literature because it highlights the discursive aspect of citizenship, and how movements produce a set of ethical practices to represents the movement with ideas of good citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Social groups struggling for civic inclusion "appeal" to an image of idealized national citizenship when making claims for citizenship rights. Idealized citizenship refers to how a nation prefers to see itself in relation to idealized cultural values and beliefs.  For instance, American social movements appeal to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
32
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
ideals of democratic citizenship and to beliefs of individual equality and nonviolence. Ideally, this means emphasizing a citizen's character and civic practice over their race, ethnicity, gender, ableness or sexuality. More importantly, symbolic citizenship refers to how social movements create the images and ideas of citizenship they claim only to represent. They appeal to idealized national citizenship in order to produce personal, social, and civic ethical practices. For the black civil rights movement, personal ethics defined the relationship blacks had with the self. It included managing bodily postures of how one spoke, walked, and presented the body in public. Social ethics defined the relationship blacks had with others, specifically, how to engage in relations with whites and other blacks. Civic ethics defined a manner and style of conduct for blacks while engaging in political practice and making claims for rights. Thus, for blacks in the civil rights movement, mastering ethical bodily practices was a strategy to project a racially non-threatening presentation of self and discredit black stereotypes.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Social movements guide their constituents to limit ethical practices indicating bad citizenship. Movements attempt to supply guidance through various methods. They use stories and narratives promising something better when speaking to members at meetings/rallies. They create representations of idealized citizens in the media to provide visual images of good civic practices in public protest. Lastly, they design pedagogical practices to train the body how to be a good citizen. This manipulating and shaping of the body teaches participants to manage their emotions in hostile situations and under difficult
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
circumstances. Social movements shape bodily postures and gestures, so that the body appears as their representation of good citizenship. Movements instruct activists to master techniques of self. The civil rights movement used the rights political project and discourses of good black citizenship to instruct blacks on deracialized techniques of self by teaching ethical practices designed to constantly monitor and inspect of the black self to ensure that they are, for instance, non-violent, even-tempered, modest and racially non-threatening when interaction with whites.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Appeals to idealized citizenship involve minimizing associations not reflecting idealized citizenship. For example, the civil rights movement made symbolic citizenship claims by associating non-violent civic practice with black citizenship. Non-violence defines, but also limits, the choice of civic practices to boycotts, marches and various forms of sit-ins. The black movement avoided violent demeanors and dispositions, in the form of initiating violence or retaliation (i.e. rioting). Movement actors were encouraged to appear non-threatening when engaging in civic practice. Thus, the rights based project used deracializing techniques of self to produce black interpretations and understandings of the black situation as being unjust, and which strategies were reasonable to stop those injustices. However, symbolic citizenship claims are exclusive to movements seeking social integration. In contrast to civic movements, nationalist and liberation movements attempt to associate meanings that reject or are the opposite of the "dominant culture". Nationalist movements often seek symbolic and sometimes real separation from the broader civic community. The
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
34
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
difference for nationalistic movements is the severity and conviction liberationists groups expect of their followers and the different cultural associations they try to attach to conduct and mannerism of their followers.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The civil rights movement used discourses of good citizenship makes normative claims about the type of citizen deserving rights. Movements appeal to idealized citizenship to minimize associations not reflecting idealized citizenship. Symbolic citizenship claims distinguish "good citizens" from "bad citizens". Good citizens reflect the idealized standards of national citizenship. Bad citizens are associated with the negative meanings of idealized citizenship. Good citizens and bad citizens are defined by the degree that they reflect idealized citizenship. Indeed, Steven Seidman (2002) argued that the idea of the "good gay" arose in the contemporary gay and lesbian struggles for civic inclusion. Good gays reflect gender conventional conduct and mannerisms that is sexually non-threatening to straight men. Since the idea of the good gay represents such a narrow slice of gay life, most gays are forced to conform and live up to an ideal they can and/or may not want to. For our purposes here, the civil rights movement distinguished an idea of the good black citizen by emphasizing the good black/bad white binary to illustrate how race should not serve as a marker for good citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Symbolic citizenship differs from other cultural sociological examinations of citizenship. For example, Alexander (1992, 1997, 1998) offers a structural approach to understanding citizenship as a way to measure civic solidarity and integration.   He argued the discourse of citizenship (or civil society) reproduces
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
35
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
itself through cultural codes. The cultural code is a binary dividing 'meaning' into sacred/profane, pure/impure, good/bad etc. Thus, he theorized that we find civic meaning in cultural codes rather than in elites or institutions, which stabilized the system of civil society, allowing for civil society's distinction and autonomy from the state. Citizens rely on the code to interpret and make sense of others actions, behaviors and motives in order to legitimate 'friends' and delegitimate 'enemies'. Although analytically and conceptually distinct, symbolic citizenship is not an antithesis to this argument. Symbolic citizenship highlights the discursive aspects of citizenship - how social movements struggle to associate their "style" of conduct and mannerisms, to produce and idea of good citizenship they claim to represent. The difference between the two approaches is at the epistemological level, in that a structural approach argues that civic codes inform how we assign meaning (sacred/profane) to social groups, while symbolic citizenship argues that movements draw from, or appeal, to civic codes as they resist how civic meaning is assigned, in order to produce new ideas of good citizenship. Symbolic Citizenship and the Body
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Movements shape ethical bodily practices to represent ideas of good citizenship. Sociological and cultural studies research theorizes the body as a cultural variable within a given cultural and historical context, to overcome binaries such as mind/body. Past debates on the body distinguished the internal body from an external body (Turner 1992, 1996). The internal body considers how actors engage practices of "asceticism" - restrain and self-control around
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
36
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the idea of purifying the self in relation to the control of pleasures, e.g. sexual, consuming alcohol or mass culture (see Sheppard 2002). The external body, which is primarily based Foucault's (1976, 1978, 1985, 1986) later works on sexuality and punishment, considers issues of representation and regulation of the body. For instance, Butler (1993) argued that bodies are not only formed through regulatory bodily practices, but we are compelled to reproduce bodily practices through rituals and performativity. Ritualized repetition (or performativity) of sexual norms produces and stabilizes a sexual subject. 'Sex', then, is an idealized construct which "functions as a norm, but is also part of a regulatory practice that produces the bodies it governs" (Butler 1993: 1). More recent sociological work on the body is centered on the idea of embodiment. Primarily based on Bourdieu's (1990) argument, embodiment considers how discourse works through the body in order to shape both cognitive and phenomenological processes of perception, evaluation and judgment. Wacquant's (2004) study on how boxing gyms regulate both the external and internal process of the body can be read, in part, as an attempt to synthesize the external/internal body. Wacquant illustrated how the boxing gym regulated the boxer's body around an idea of the good boxer. The good boxer trains, learns to throw a proper punch, shadow boxes, exercises with the 'rhythm' of the gym, but is also taught proper dietary practices of restraining from unhealthy foods and sex.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
This dissertation conceptualizes the body as a political object to be disciplined.     It examines  how the  civil  rights  movement  used  competing
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
37
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
discourses to organize deracialized techniques of self and ethical bodily practices. I highlight Foucault's use of the body in what he describes as the technique of self (1986). Technique of self refers to how individuals go about transforming, correcting, and regulating their civic practices in order to highlight and develop good black citizenship. For example, I analyze how the rights political project used discourses of good black citizenship to design pedagogical practices for their "citizenship schools", which instructed activists how to master affective responses, so that blacks could refrain from lashing out violently or hysterically when confronting violent whites. The citizenship schools taught personal, social and civic practices by combining adult literacy with instructions on how to evaluate and judge what counted as good citizenship. SNCC designed "community centers" for freedom summer, which instructed dietary practices, how to fashion/dress the body, and how to sew and maintain the appearance of ones home. Thus, the rights political project used discourses of good black citizenship to discipline movement activists the movement by teaching them to regulate their self around idea of good black citizen as a resistance to racializing good citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Situating the body in social movement research allows for an analysis of how movements shape bodily practices to indicate ideas of good citizenship. By introducing the body to social movement scholarship, I am critiquing two aspects of the cultural turn - the emphasis on cognition and the 'role' of emotions. The cognitive claim cuts through both framing and collective identity. Since framing has been aptly criticized, and in part discredited in favor of narrative and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
38
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
discourse, I narrow my critique or the cognitive aspect of collective identity. Eyerman and Jamison (1991) 'cognitive praxis' skirts some of the problems with framing by considering the knowledge producing activities of the movement, but reproduces others. That is, movement intellectuals are responsible for much of a movement's ideas and strategies, and work to convince others through organizational, technical and collective memory/rediscovery of black history strategies. Yet, Eyerman and Jamison fail to say how knowledge transmitted or produced, other than to say cognition exists in all human actions. Integral to shaping collective identities and civic practices is the manipulation and training of the body. As I show in chapter 3, the rights political project instructed blacks on practices of good handwriting to teach the meanings and pronunciations of a civic vocabulary. They also used role-playing practices, where civil rights activists' simulated 'real' protest, to learn how to hold ones temper and cover up the body to minimize pain, when confronted by violent whites and southern police. The cognitive focus has no account of embodiment, or the disciplining of the body. The separation mind/body misses ho the body helps to explain how the discourse of good black citizenship is materialized, fixing the movement's collective identity to blacks by regulating good civic practices. Hence, my critique is on the sole emphasis on cognitive and collective consciousness of the movement that overlooks how the body is regulated and controlled through power.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
My second critique is the relationship between body and emotions.  The increased  study  of emotions  in  social  movement  research  also  critiques
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
39
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
emphasis on cognition, in favor of a cognitive and emotional focus that illustrates how emotions are tied into culturally defined moral values (Jasper 1998, Goodwin, Jasper, Polletta 2000). Emotions are important for social movements because they are communicative and contain both a subject and object (afraid of something) (Jasper 1998, Blee 1998). For existing social movement research, emotions round out cultural theories on collective identities and social networks, as well as offer unique analysis of "moral shocks" and differences between negative and positive affective bonds. Besides shared cognition, emotions help to build a sense of community and 'reinforce commitment' between members. Emotions like shame or guilt are sometimes the object of change (Taylor 1989). Women's groups have also used emotional standards of victimization to create political empathy frames that cast victims as positively viewed agents (Dunn 2004). Debunking stereotypes of the 'angry feminist', research on 'anger' and feminist protest illustrated that woman join social movements and engage in collective action because it offers emotional support to transform negative emotions into positive emotions of injustice (Hemes 1999, Reger 2004). Movements themselves rely on 'moral shocks' - those unexpected and exceptional events that create a sense of outrage, causing individuals to become politically active and aware (Jasper 1997, Reed 2004). Emotions can also cause a movement to disintegrate. Klatch's study on SDS argues that negative affective bonds produced "competition, pressure and intolerance, which causes the deterioration of group solidarity" (2004: 489).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
40
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Despite the move away from cognitively orientated movement research, the study of emotions continues to reproduce the mind/body binary. The body is overlooked even in studies where it appears to be at the center of analysis. For instance, the landmark book in the study of emotion, Hochschild's Managed Heart, considers how the 'love of the job' and positive emotions have become products for sale: "The emotional style of offering the service is part of the service itself" (2003: 5). She shows how flight attendants are instructed to 'smile' and manage their emotions to ensure that, among other things, customers are not upset. Rather than analyze the body, Hochschild draws from Goffmann's symbolic interactionism to say these emotions are part of the presentation of self at work - the front stage - where real emotions are forced to the back stage. Jasper's argument on emotions and social movements echo's her sentiment: "Emotions are learned and controlled through social interactions, although never with complete effectiveness" (Jasper 1998: 388). Thus, emotions are learned through social interactions, which may or may not be regulated, but are independent and autonomous from the body. While both Hotchschild and Jasper correctly argue that emotions have to be learned, they do not answer how we learn to manage our emotions for political reasons.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition, theories of emotions fail to explain the discursive aspect of emotions. Goodwin, Jasper and Polletta argued, "like other aspects of culture, such as cognitive meanings or moral principles, emotions are shaped by social expectations as much as they are emanations form individuals personalities" (2000:78).     They  failed   to  explain   how  movements   manage  the   social
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
41
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
expectations and personalities of their supporters and adversaries. Movements attempt to regulate where, when and how emotion is used or not used. The rights political project drew distinctions between their supporters and bad citizens based on the bad citizens' inability to manage their emotions. In contrast, the black nationalist project used discourses of black authenticity to produce an idea of violent and revolutionary black political agent that intimated and scarred whites into giving blacks power. Thus, there is a discursive element to 'emotional work' that instructs the body how to react to and control bodily desires and pleasures that can be provoked from either positive or negative emotions. The black movement invested in techniques to control and contain anger and resentment. The rights political project used discourse of good black citizenship to minimize anger and resentment for political reasons. Politically, blacks wanted to avoid associations with irrationality - public emotions of anger and yelling - but also wanted to regulate emotions - like crying or hysteria - to not appear 'feminine'. They also regulated which bodies, (child's body, student's body, women's body) were presented and placed in public space and in organizational pamphlets asking for money to volunteers, to cultivate empathetic emotional bonds within heterogeneous local geopolitical factions of the black community. Thus, my point of departure of the study of emotions in social movements is to consider the discursive aspects of social movement through the political relations between body and emotions. CONCLUSION
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
42
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The civil rights literature focuses on questions of organizations, the movements form, and its decline. Blacks mobilized through their church based organizational structure that allows them to take advantage of political opportunities in the state. King situated the movement's message in democracy and Christianity, which brought white support and defined the movement's identity. The movement declined because the federal government ended their support, and activists felt a sense of completion and frustration. Subsequent black political struggles have failed to energize the black community around common strategies, ideas or issues. Scholars have used these developments of the civil rights movement to argue for the importance of social movement organizations, strategic framing, collective identity and political opportunity structures. Yet, they do not consider issues of social movement and citizenship representation, the movements' pedagogical practices, how the black body was the object of these practices, which cannot be reduced social structures.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The limitations in the civil rights literature provide the opportunity to rethink the civil rights movement in terms other than organizations, frames and social structure and identity. A starting point is on how the movement approached citizenship. The civil rights movement was aware of what constituted good citizenship and importance of good civic practices. The rights political project used discourses of good black citizenship to define a set of ethical practices for blacks to master that represented blacks with an idea of good American citizenship. The rights project used discourses of good black citizenship as a deracializing strategy to challenge how America privileged race to determine
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
43
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
which citizens were included in the national civic culture. The production and reproduction of good black civic practices in public spaces changed white support on the state's and local geopolitical authority's use of violence to reproduce white privilege. Additionally, the rights projects normative claims associated with deracializing black citizenship created boundaries between 'good black' and 'bad black' citizenship. The black nationalist project produced an idea of an authentic black political agent in relation to deracializing strategies and whiteness. As blacks, especially blacks affiliated with SNCC, began to question the possibilities of black-white reconciliation and the value of nonviolent civic practice, they began to use discourses of black authenticity to produce new practices and strategies to obtain power rather than civic inclusion. The competing claims over black citizenship continue to be important today. The rights project, which dominated public discourse on black citizenship and racial equality, marginalized the black nationalist political project as a violent and irrational normative ideal, and thus, anchoring its ideas of authentic blackness to the margins of American civic an black political cultures.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The next chapter analyzes how the rights political project used discourses of good black citizenship to produce a set of ethical practices to represent blacks with an idea of good citizenship. The focus is on how the movement, especially through King, created an idea of mastering deracialized personal, social, and civic ethical practices. I show how the movement emphasized the good black -bad white binary opposition to displace bad whites from power and illustrate how race should not serve as a marker for good citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
44
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Chapter three analyzes how SCLC and SNCC used four "movement programs" - citizenship schools, role-playing workshops, grassroots leadership training, and freedom schools and community centers - to train the black body how to master personal, social and civic ethical bodily practices. The first part of the chapter traces the sociological and historical development of how and why SCLC combined ideas of voter registration and adult education into citizenship schools to instruct techniques of deracialized black self. The analysis includes how instructing and mastering ethical practices came in steps. First, blacks had to master personal ethical practices - how to master ones affective responses, how to practice good manners - before proceeding to social ethical practices. After mastering social ethical practices of interacting with blacks and whites, they moved on to mastering civic ethical practices of how to canvass a neighborhood for voter registration, how to hold a mass meeting, and how to prepare and protect the body during public protest to remain nonviolent. I also compare the differences in how SCLC and the rights project versus how SNCC used a grassroots project. Both projects used discourses of good black citizenship. However, SNCC worked mainly with poor blacks, the occasionally poor white, and rural black communities, whereas SCLC was more involved in urban areas. In contrast to SCLC's affiliate program, where leaders came from the black church, SNCC's grassroots project involved training activists on mastering good ethical practices to take in the field and instruct other blacks on good ethical practices. SNCC also instructed good health and dietary practices, to bring immediate improvements to the rural black communities, and concentrated
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
45
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
around organizing blacks and whites based on the shared a local geopolitical culture, rather than by using an idea of a shared nation-state.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Chapter four analyzes how the black nationalist project used discourses of black authenticity to challenge the idea that deracializing black citizenship would lead to racial equality and improvements for the black community. The first part of the chapter concentrates on how Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam produced a normative ideal of the authentic black citizen by abstaining from associations of whiteness and in relation to deracializing strategies. The black nationalist project, in particular, defined racialized techniques of self to attach the black self to the racial group rather than the nation-state, and emphasized the use of emotional bodily practices as a representation of the real black response to racial discrimination. The second half of the chapter analyzes how SNCC grassroots projects, based on local geopolitical identifications, provided openings for members to use discourses of black authenticity to organize around an idealized black only political identity and reject the use of nonviolent civic practice. The conclusion compares the rights political project and black nationalist project, and uses SNCC to consider the question of how groups become more revolutionary.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The final chapter is a case study on the Selma to Movement and Meredith March. Whereas the chapter four analyzes the how SNCC adopts the black nationalist project, this chapter highlights how the movement splits into two competing political projects. I provide an alternative explanation to prevailing theories on why the black movement declines at the point of its greatest 'success'.   First, I provide an overview of Selma's local geopolitical culture, and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
46
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the divergent strategies found in both the black movement and local police practice. Then, I show the post-Voting rights political culture, along with the challenged posed by the black nationalist project, split the movement into two competing fractions based on the question of what to do next by changing the object and subject of civil rights protest. More specifically, the projects differed on questions of 1) organizing on a national or local level in the continued struggle for black equality 2) pedagogical practices of movement programs 3) the form of civic practices, and 4) the their approach to urban revitalization. I conclude the chapter with an analysis of how the black nationalist challenge to the rights project forced the rights project to abandon the good black/bad white binary and focus on the good black/bad black normative claims. Despite the decline of the movement, I show how the ideas of deracialized and racialized black political agents produced by the competing political projects continues to serve as normative ideals for blacks to model subsequent political struggle.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
47
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
CHAPTER 2: THE RIGHTS POLITICAL PROJECT AND DISCOURSES OF GOOD BLACK CITIZENSHIP
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The rights political project, which made up the dominant position of civil
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
rights movement, used discourses of good black citizenship to produce the idea
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
of the good black citizen.   What the rights project meant by the good black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizens racially non-threatening, even tempered, physically nonviolent black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizens, who reflected heteronormative American masculinity and femininity, so
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
that could they could integrate into the national polity as equal citizens, while at
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the same time, displacing bad whites from positions of power.    They used
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
discourses   of   good   black   citizenship   as   a   deracializing   strategy   that
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
disassociated racial stereotypes from black citizenship. Drawing from the cultural
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
ideals of good American citizenship, the rights project defined a set of normative
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
ethical practices that defined and placed limits on how blacks should approach
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
civic  inclusion.     The symbiotic  relationship  between  good  citizenship  and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
idealized American civic culture suggests that idea of the "good American citizen"
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
is not autonomous concept.   For instance, the Nation of Islam disciplined and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
cultivated an image of blacks as exhibiting good manners and good character,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
but they intertwined good black practices with a conflicting American civic
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
tradition of revolution, separation, and non-western religion (Muslim) and a
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
competing set of goals of producing black political autonomy (see chapter 4).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Thus, the larger implications of the rights project was producing an idealized
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black citizen to illustrate why democracy worked better when racial, and to an
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
extent class, identities were suppressed in favor of universal and idealized
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizenship practices.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
48
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The rights political project used discourses of good citizenship makes normative claims about the type of citizen deserving of rights. That is, they produced an idea of what should represent black citizenship and distinguished an idealized black citizenship from what they defined as bad black citizenship. Discourses of good black citizenship included four normative categories - good blacks, bad blacks, good whites and bad whites. Idealized American citizenship defined each of the four categories in relation to the degree that they reflected idealized citizenship. The rights project emphasized the good black -bad white binary opposition to displace bad southern whites from power. They used discourses of good black citizenship contrasted good blacks with bad whites to illustrate how race should not serve as a marker for good citizenship. In contrast, the black nationalist project used discourses of black authenticity, which contrasted the good black and bad black binary, to define and distinguish an normative idea of the authentic black citizen. Thus, the rights political project produced a set of ethical practices that defined the 'right way' to be a good citizen for blacks and whites.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
We see how the rights project used discourses of good black citizenship begins to shape deracialized technique of self that represented the idea of good black citizenship in texts produced primarily by Martin Luther King, pamphlets and public materials produced by Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).2 These texts defined a normative rhetoric of talking, discussing and defining blacks'
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
2 This chapter focuses on SNCC as part of the rights project, before they began to draw from the grassroots project and before their transformation to into a black nationalist group.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
49
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
practices, as well as aligning black citizenship with the idea of good citizenship, and a set of bodily ethical practices to master, which produced the idea of good black citizenship. Taken as a whole, these texts represent how the rights project sought to define the immediate goals of the movement, as well as fix an interpretation and collective memory of movement events. This chapter draws from the above text between 1954 and 1965. I selected this time-period because it spans the beginning of the Montgomery Bus Boycott to the start of the Selma Movement. Chapter 5 will specifically deal with the Selma movement and how post-Voting Rights Act affected black political practice. I analyzed the texts to isolate important patterns and clusters of thought that illustrate how the rights project portrayed blacks as good citizens deserving of rights. The organizational pamphlets, memorandums, minutes to meetings etc. illustrate how the movement designed guidelines and instruction on, for instance, how to exhibit good manners and refraining from violence, as well as the narratives and stories used to portray blacks as good citizens. I organized the chapter by analytical category, or themes, rather than teleological sequence. It is not a history of all aspects of the civil rights movement.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Historical Overview of the Rights Project and Deracialized Ideas of American Citizenship
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The rights political project drew from American ideals of democratic citizenship while constructing the idea of good black citizenship. Although the movement resisted racialized citizenship, the cultural features of American citizenship still shaped the form and articulation of a deracialized American
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
50
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizenry. The civil rights movement articulated their idea of good black citizenship through existing meanings of citizenship - including a discourse of rights, responsibilities and what counts as good citizenship. Two important ideas of good American citizenship was the idea of adulthood signifying the independent and rational good citizen, and 19th century liberal protestant cultures that nurtured ideals of self-mastery in relation to nonviolence and refraining from social vice (drinking, gambling etc.).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The formation of the American state in 1776 included a variety of exclusionary restrictions on whom and what counted as good citizenship. The right to vote and participate in governing affairs was, in part, predicated on property ownership. Catholics, Jews, Quakers and blacks were also excluded. The move to incorporate additional white men into the polity began in 1792 when New Hampshire became the first state to eliminate property ownership as a condition for enfranchisement. Property ownership gave way to an achieved status of 'adulthood' as a new the basis for American citizenship. Citizenship became a status adults acquired with age. It established a hierarchy based on age (man/boy) which drew from the idea that men acquired wisdom over time. In addition, the system of slavery racialized adulthood by linking good citizenship with economic self-mastery, which distinguished "man from slave" and distinguishing and established a "minimum of social dignity" for whites in relation to blacks (see Shklar 1991: 1-3). No matter how destitute poor whites were, skin color alone provided minimal social advantages relative to blacks. For blacks, denied them associations with the capacity to control ones life and make rational
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
51
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
decisions that remained after slavery ended.   The idea of dignity 'achieved'
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
through economic self-mastery linked idealized images of the white laborer with a
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
working class male identity.  As culture of 'individuation' and 'self-directed work'
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
became the dominant position in early 19th America, it solidified the idea of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
independence  with   ideas   of  rationality,   and   voting   became  the   political
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
representation of a deliberate, conscious and independent act (Wiebe 1997: 30-
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
31).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Southern whites continued to harden racial boundaries after the American
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Civil War, and through subsequent Southern Reconstruction.    Whites used
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
violent practices to produce and maintain a sovereign white political polity. They
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
erected obstacles to prevent blacks from voting, thus restricting blacks from
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
associations with 19th century ideals of American citizenship.   Whites justified
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
excluding blacks from political power on the basis that blacks were not morally
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
capable of handling the responsibility.  For instance, the White Citizens Councils'
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
often cited former Mississippi Governor (1904-1908) James K Vardaman on his
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
views on blacks and democracy:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The Negro should never have been trusted with the ballot. He is different from the white man. He is congenitally unqualified to exercise the most responsible duty of citizenship. He is physically, mentally, morally, racially and eternally the white mans inferior. There is nothing in his race, nothing in his individual character, nothing in his achievements of the past nor his promise of the future which entitles him to stand side by side with the white man at the ballot box (RS 1-10).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The Vardaman text represented a racializing strategy to produce a democratic
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
culture that excluded blacks on the basis that they are not fit for democratic
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizenship.  White Mississippians excluded blacks to ensure whites maintained
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
52
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
exclusive access to state resources, and by the 1930s, New Deal federal money. Because there were more blacks in Mississippi then whites in 1892 Mississippi started issuing literacy tests. The law stated that "a person had to be able to read any section of the Mississippi constitution, or understood any section when read to him, to give a reasonable interpretation of any section" (quoted from SNCC pamphlet, located in RS 1-10). Blacks were required to interpret any one of the 244 sections of the Mississippi constitution. However, it mattered less who did the interpreting than who judged and decided the legitimacy of the interpretation. As long as whites occupied all positions of political authority in the Mississippi state government, they excluded blacks from political power. The practice of using literacy tests to exclude blacks became the primary focus of SCLC's political programs and the subject of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Besides the age and racial classifications, the idea of mastering the bodily pleasures of what one ate, drank and the social space it frequented slowly emerged as representations of good citizenship. While southern whites drew from old south political cultures, specifically ideas that blacks were morally inferior to whites, and thus, not worthy of American citizenship rights, the rights project's drew from liberal protestant culture that linked ideas of nonviolence and good character with good citizenship. Liberal protestant culture included the Garrisonians, the nonviolent anti-slavery advocates, as well as mid-19th century temperance and self-help movements, and progressive thinkers. Rather than produce new rights, however, the 'self-help' movements of the 1840s attempted to improve American civic mannerisms and character. What the self-help groups
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
53
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
thought needed improving were the bad mannerisms associated with American politics, including eating habits, tobacco chewing, and public violence between political opponents (see Wiebe 1995: 49-50). In relation to masculine ideals of toughness with independence, self-help groups proposed avoiding practices like gambling, fighting, and drinking in favor of sobriety, frugality, buying homes and joining churches (see Wiebe 1995: 61-85). The idea of good manners emerged as a way to regulate a civic populace and establish the basis for intra-white hierarchies between political and economic elites and the 'mass culture' populace.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The self-help and temperance movement gave way to the American progressive movement that cemented associations of the good Christian with American nationalism, as well as new political strategy focused on shaping and manipulating public opinion. Eisenach argues that from 1880-1918, a progressive "regime of thought" emerged that combined a "language of social science, social control, community character, piety and memory, created systems of knowledge and institutional structures" (1994:46) to reconstitute personal identities and American citizenship. The idea behind the progressive project was to define a religious identity of 'liberal Protestantism', which would serve as the cultural structural basis for a good democratic public culture. For the progressive project, good citizens were Christians, and preferably Protestant. This also implied Americans were not Jewish, Muslim or Hindi, e.g. non-Christians. Indeed, King drew from liberal protestant intellectuals and pacifists such as
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
54
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Niebuhr, Thoreau, in addition to Gandhi and black intellectual culture3 as the source for his approach to nonviolence.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to associating the good Christian with an American national citizenship, progressive reformers reconstituted the idea of public opinion. The progressive idea of public opinion differed from James Madison, who associated public opinion with community values, and mid-19th century ideas of public opinion as a governmental form of social control (See Wiebe 1995: 38). The progressive approach to shaping public opinion also differed from the anti-slavery and women suffrage movements approach to social change. Although the women's movement changed public sentiment on child labor, the age of sexual consent, and food safety and public sanitation prior to winning suffrage, they joined the Republican Party in order to get their reforms into the public sphere (see Eisenach 1994: 81, Spain 2001). The progressive strategy sought political reform by concentrating their efforts in the most politically influential geographic territory, from New York to Chicago, rather than attempting to form political coalitions or independent parties. The progressives utilized their positions as college professors and periodical editors to have immediate access to the public sphere. They mastered the art shaping public opinion as a technique of resistance. Good citizens used their intellect, expertise and skill to initiate political change. They did not have to march or demonstrate to directly appeal to local representatives. The civil rights movement, especially SCLC, drew from this strategy of shaping public opinion be concentrating their political efforts in the
&lt;/p&gt;

3 Information on  how King  drew from  liberalism,  black intellectual culture and  Gandhi's satayaghara can be found in Ansbro [1982] 2000, Garrow 1986: 42-48, Lischer 1995: 51-64)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
south, in relation to bad whites, in order to sway national sentiment and support for citizenship rights.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The decline of the progressive movement coincided with the rise of pacifism and peace cultures in the interwar period. Peace cultures nurtured the ideas of using nonviolent direct action as technique to end racial repression and global conflict, including world wars and colonialism. The peace culture that developed around WW 1 drew from socialist, feminist and Christian ideas to critique war-time economies, the defense of civil liberties and ideas of nonviolence (see Early 1997: 189-200). The peace culture challenged American ideas of the good soldier representing good citizenship. Individuals who influenced King's views on nonviolence spent time in pacifist cultures, including Glen Smiley and James Lawson of the liberal protestant group Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) (WF 29-1). Rustin, a World War 2 conscientious objector, spent time in prison for his pacifist beliefs (see Garrow 1986: 66). The civil rights movement drew from the peace culture on using the body as a non-violent weapon against violent and aggressive white police.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The above developments of American citizenship illustrated the cultural features of good American citizenship. The rights project drew from idealized good American citizenship to produce a deracialized technique of self that represented blacks as idealized citizens. Despite using a deracializing discursive strategy, they nevertheless retained social categories of good citizens as independent, self-directed, rational and a property of adult masculinity. Next, I will explain how King defined a set of ethical practices, which organized the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
56
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
deracialized techniques of self, and represented good black citizens capable of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
integrating into the civic polity.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Good Black Citizenship and Deracialized Techniques of Self
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
King, who publicly represented the black rights project, used discourses of good black citizenship to outline a set of practices for blacks to master. King used discourses of good black citizenship as a deracializing strategy to disassociate black citizenship from unfair and harmful stereotypes by shaping ethical practices that reflected idealized citizenship. In particular, mastering deracialized techniques of self required mastering affective response to limit black associations with black stereotypes of being savage, angry, and lacking the self-control that makes one prone to violent and emotional outbursts. In addition, the rights project did not want blacks participating in violent civic practices such a rioting or fighting police. In order to accomplish this, the movement outlined a series of techniques on how to observe, monitor, correct, and improve a set of ethical practices in relation to conduct in relation to idealized American citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The idea of black self-improvement was a contested issue in the late 1950s. King's book editors and advisors edited out the subject of black self-improvement in his first book Stride Toward Freedom and the subsequent collection of sermons in Strength to Love (see Lewis 1970, Garrow 1986). Nevertheless, the idea of "black self-improvement" was a dominant theme throughout his sermons. King's most important and definitive sermon, titled 'Loving Your Enemies', was first given in 1957. He posed the question on how to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
57
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
overcome the fear and hatred of the other in relation to improving bad civic
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
practices.   The sermons, in their original unedited, form featured the common
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
themes of outlining how to limit bad practices and how to identify good practices
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
in others.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In order to understand how the rights project used discourses of good
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black citizenship to produce the idea of good black citizenship and fashion it onto
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the black populace, we can analyze  King's arguments for "why" and  his
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
suggestions for "how" blacks can/should be good black citizens.    First, King
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
wanted to convince black Americans that deracialized techniques of self were the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
best and most effective resistance practices.   Mastering good ethical practices
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
was a resistance practice that displaced race as the marker of good citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Idealized American  citizenship  based  membership and  rights on  objective
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
standards of achievement.   Therefore, King distinguished why denying equal
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizenship    differed   from    interpersonal    reasons    attributed    to    ascribed
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
characteristics:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Now, I'm aware of the fact that some people will not like you, not because of something you have done to them, but they won't like you... Some people aren't going to like the way you walk... like the way to talk... Some people aren't going to like you because your skin is a little brighter than theirs; and others aren't going to like you because your skin is a little darker than theirs... They're going to dislike you not because of something that you've done to them, but because of various jealous reactions and other reactions that are so prevalent in human nature (King [1957] 1998:43).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
For King, equal citizenship for blacks was not a question of whites liking blacks,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
which meant outlining a standard of acceptance, but rather, a question of what
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
counts as good citizenship for blacks and whites.   Whites could accept blacks
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
58
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and still deny them equal citizenship rights. In order to integrate into the American polity, King had to change the associations of good American citizenship and make blacks reflect that ideal. Therefore, mastering deracialized techniques of self provided a method of displacing bad whites from power and race from good citizenship, and producing a normative ideal of black citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
For blacks, mastering deracialized techniques of self was necessary to convince the general American public, especially whites, that blacks were good citizens who deserved rights. King argued that mastering deracialized techniques of self as the most effective way to debunk black stereotypes and prove they were unwarranted and unfair. He argued that, "the Negro must make a vigorous effort to improve his personal standards. The only answer that we can give to those who through blindness and fear would question our readiness and capability is that our lagging standards exist because of the legacy of slavery and segregation, inferior schools, slums, and second class-citizenship" (King [1960] 1986: 149). King isolated bodily practices as the site of power and resistance. He argued that failing to master deracialized techniques of self represented blacks as irrational black political agents. Because bad posture, bad manners, sloppy, unkempt, and unclean appearance were attributes of bad citizenship, King argued blacks should minimize and eliminate them. Unlike bodily conduct, race is an ascribed attribute that blacks cannot change. King wanted blacks to concentrate on modifying their bodily practices because it was something that blacks could control. Blacks could not control how state actors -police, social workers - or bad whites acted towards them.   They could master
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
59
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
techniques of self that whites used to justify the subject of their ire. Deracializing personal and ethical practices meant exposing bad white anti-democratic and racialized practices. Thus, King isolated bad bodily conduct as the site of self-improvement that could disassociate or sever the significations of race from bad citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Secondly, King identified a series of techniques for blacks to use in everyday life that could guide them in how to identify and correct bad civic practices. First, King noted that, "In order to love your enemies, you must begin by analyzing self" (King [1957] 1998: 42). Blacks should contrast the self with idealized citizenship practices. Contrasting the good black self in relation to idealized citizenship practices overcame the problem of mimicking bad white civic practices as an expression of good citizenship. On the one hand, 'copying' whites would have confirmed that 'whiteness' equated into good citizenship. On the other hand, blacks copying bad whites' reinforced ideas that race marked good citizenship. In addition to his sermons, King publicly reiterated how blacks can transform themselves into good black citizens. One technique required blacks to ask themselves "how may I transform this liability into an asset?'" (King [1963] 1964: 209). He wanted blacks to isolate bad practices that whites used to deny them rights and transform them into good practices that resisted the rationale that blacks did not deserve rights because of character deficiencies. In other publications, King suggested that blacks diligently seek to improve on their present skills and practices, "For whatever demands the Negro justly makes on his fellow citizens are not an effort to lift responsibility from himself.... he will
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
60
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
have to learn new skills, new duties, and creatively and constructively to embrace a new way of life" (King 1964: 167). Blacks had to improve an entire set of ethical practices if they were to represent good black citizens. Black demands for rights would only be accepted once blacks convinced the American public that they were worthy not only worthy of rights, but also worthy of full civic inclusion into public life. Therefore, we should view the civil rights movement as preparing blacks for more that the political right to vote. The idea behind good black citizenship was a way to master good civic practice, so that blacks could enjoy the full range of citizenship, e.g. running for office, holding office, engaging in public debate, and assuming positions of public authority.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Good black citizens refrained from violence to exhibit respect to others and respect for the self. Nonviolence meant refraining from physical attacks, as well as refraining from exhibiting violent demeanors and conduct that provoked 'fear' or 'hatred' in others. King used discourses of good black citizenship to link nonviolence with self-improvement, "Our most fruitful course is to stand firm with courageous determination, move forward nonviolently amid obstacles and setbacks, accept disappointments, and cling to hope. Our determined refusal not to be stopped will eventually open the door of fulfillment" (King [1963] 1964: 209). Nonviolence served as an ideal that regulated a very general method of self-improvement. Mastering nonviolent practices reinforced idealized democratic standards and debunked black stereotypes.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In sum, the rights project produced an idea of good black citizenship to attach the deracialized black self to the nation-state.  It represented the idea that
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
61
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
all citizens had to abandon, or at least downplay, the use of racial identities to define citizenship, as full membership and inclusion into the polity, if democracy was to work and fulfill its vast promises and potential. King associated deracialized techniques of self with the expansion of the black movement, "gradually the Negro masses in the south began to reevaluate themselves - a process that was to change the nature of the Negro community and doom the social patterns of the South ... We Negroes have replaced self-pity with self-respect and self-determination with dignity" (King [1956] 1986: 76). King credited the capacity of the black movement to expand and maintain a presence over time and geographical space, in part, to the idea of good black citizenship and deracialized techniques of self to the "success" and capacity of the movement to integrate into the American polity. GOOD BLACK CITIZENSHIP ETHICS
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The rights project used discourses of good black citizenship to define three ethical practices - personal ethics, social ethics and civic ethics. Personal ethics defined the relationship blacks had with their self. It included managing bodily postures of how one talked and walked that organized a deracialized self and produced a unitary political agent and image of good black citizenship. Social ethics defined the relationship blacks had with others. Social ethics included mastering good manners to ensure cordial and rational relations with whites and other blacks, how to manage interracial sexual relations, in order to discredit black stereotypes. Civic ethics defined how blacks should use their mastery of personal and social ethics in their political practice.   Mastering civic
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
62
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
ethics required limiting emotional outbursts (anger, hysteria) when debating matters of public concern, conducting media interviews, and demonstrating for rights. Thus, mastering the set of ethical practices was how blacks used the deracializing strategy that represented them as good citizens. Although each set of ethical practices had a symbiotic relationship with the others, I nevertheless analyzed each one separately for the sake of clarity. Personal Ethics and Good Black Citizenship
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The rights project guided blacks on how to manage and master a set of personal practices that projected idealized good black citizenship. We find two dominant themes pertaining to personal ethical practices. The first is "good manners", which included ideas of cleanliness, connotations of higher education, and attractiveness. The second is "good character", which included ideas of what counts as dignity and how to master pleasures and emotions association with bad citizenship. A central idea pertaining to both good manners and good character was blacks being attentive of their bodily postures. The rights project used discourses of good black citizenship to define good manners in relation to the manner in which blacks walked and dressed. The idea behind a proper way of walking is associated with self-confidence and self-respect. The rights project wanted blacks to master bodily practices of walking with their heads up, shoulders back and looking at others in the eye to convey signified meanings of being trustworthy and respectable citizens. King noted the change in blacks' bodily postures as the civil rights movement began to take its shape "The increased self-respect of even the least sophisticated Negroes in Montgomery is
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
63
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
evident in the way they dress and walk, in new standards of cleanliness and of general deportment" (King [1958] 1964: 118). Blacks involved in the movement began exhibiting ethical bodily practices signifying meanings of cleanliness. They disassociated themselves from black stereotypes and meanings of bad citizenship - dirty, unintelligent, and not trustworthy - associated with race, poverty and newly arrived immigrants. Repetitive bodily practices of walking upright, wearing 'nicer' and less racialized clothing reproduced good black citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In contrast to good black citizens mastering good manners exhibited through their bodily postures, King distinguished how bad white personal practices did not reflect idealized citizenship. King observed how the whites in the Montgomery courthouse watching the trial of seven whites arrested for bombing his house were not 'clean': "One could tell from the dress and manner of the whites that most of them were poor and uneducated, the kind that would find security in the Ku Klux Klan. As we entered they looked at us with undisguised hate" (King [1958] 1964: 113). King noted that bad whites' sloppy and unkempt personal ethical practices associated them with bad citizenship. King made this distinction of differing personal practices to illustrate that bad conduct is not racially determined. King also wanted bad whites to improve their personal ethical practices. Bad whites did not practice any personal ethical standards of cleanliness or civility. Rather, they sought to distinguish themselves by using violence to police racial boundaries, and reproduce the idea that white skin equated to good citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
64
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to the idea of cleanliness, the rights project used discourses of good black citizenship to argue that blacks should master the personal ethical practices associated with higher education and intelligence. King drew from the ideas that higher education cultivated more culturally refined citizens. King emphasized good manners and higher education to distance blacks from images as dirty sharecroppers or street thugs. He noted that the new civil rights protesters, especially the students of SNCC, differ from past black citizens: "But neither is the Negro today an elderly women whose grammar is uncertain; rather, he is college-bred, Ivy League-clad, youthful, articulate and resolute. He has the imagination and drive of the young, tamed by discipline and commitment" (King [1961] 1986e: 160). King associated good black manners with Ivy League colleges. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, this would have produced an image of an elite group of men, dressed in Brooks Brother's attire, epitomizing the mannerisms of a respected and knowledgeable citizen. King used representations of black college protesters as well spoken, clear in intention, and conveying their displeasure with unfair racialized hierarchies rationally, to indicate that good blacks reflected idealized American citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Indeed, SNCC's importance and 'success' was about more than just a commitment to "the philosophical or religious ideal of nonviolence as the foundation of our purpose, the presupposition of our faith, and the manner of our action" (EB 5-2). SNCC used discourses of good citizenship to argue that black stereotypes denied opportunities to blacks with achieved educational attainment: "Thus, many college trained Negroes are offered the mop and broom when
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
65
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
seeking employment in private industry" (EB 5-2).  The students went to school,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
worked hard, and embodied good citizenship. Yet, whites still denied students
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
equal employment.   Subsequent talk and discussion of the students' personal
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
ethical practices during the sit-ins distinguished the students as good citizens.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
King emphasized how the students mastered affective and bodily response by
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
refraining from violence: "few students are attracted to extreme nationalist sects
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
advocating black supremacy.  The students have anger under controlling bonds
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
of discipline" (King [1961] 1986e: 164).    Noting that SNCC was a disciplined
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
movement shielded them from critiques of irrationality so SNCC could articulate
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the excitement of spontaneity sweeping through black college.    Additionally,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
James Farmer distinguished the students from bad whites based on their
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
presentation of self:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Newspaper and television accounts of the sit-ins suggested a picture which reversed the common stereotypes. Inside, at the lunch counters, sat well-dressed, well-mannered Negro college students with their calculus and philosophy books, quietly asking for a cup of coffee; outside, crowds of white boys with duck tailed haircuts and leather jackets grinned and shuffled their feet to start trouble (Farmer 1965: 67-68)
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Farmer distinguished the students from white youths based on each of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
their fashion and mannerisms. Good black students were engaged in techniques
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
of self-improvement - reading philosophy and mathematics.   They were neatly
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
dressed and well mannered. Asking for a cup of coffee quietly made them polite.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In contrast to the good black students, bad whites exhibited bad bodily posture.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
They shuffled their feet rather than walking upright and looking others in the eye.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Grinning  associated  them  with   being  obnoxious  and   mischievous.     This
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
66
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
associated bad whites with a general lack of respect for the self and others. Bad whites reject techniques of self-improvement in favor of using violence to hold back good blacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Good black citizens were clean, educated, as they exhibited a personal appearance that represented blacks as charming and attractive. An attractive citizen is the type of person that exhibits conventional American beauty norms, as has a pleasant personality. Describing the personal ethical practices of the students, King said, "I am no longer surprised to meet attractive, stylishly dressed young girls whose charm and personality would grace a junior prom and to hear them declare in unmistakably sincere terms, 'Dr. King, I am ready to die if I must" (King [1961] 1986e: 161). Deracializing the black self meant mastering practices of charm and physical beauty, which are embodied representations of cleanliness. This differed from the personal ethical practices of bad whites. Bad whites who screamed obscenities in public did not represent idealized American citizenship. Regarding bad whites personal ethics involved in defying desegregation laws, King contrasted good blacks with bad whites: "One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly (not hatefully as the white mothers did in New Orleans when they were seen on television screaming, 'nigger, nigger, nigger') and with a willingness to accept the penalty" (King [1963] 1986a: 294). Whereas good black women represented polite, charming and attractive citizens, bad white women represented unpleasant, vile and repulsive citizens. Good citizens do not scream obscenities at children attempting to go to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
67
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
school.   Good women do not reflect the manners of bad white men relying on
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
skin color to distinguish themselves from blacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The second set of ethical practices we find in the rights project's text are
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the ideas of mastering personal ethical practices to shape good black character.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The rights project sought to deracialize the associations of good character in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
order to define good character as an achieved status that citizens must practice
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and master in place of using race to define good character.    Deracializing
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizenship is necessary not only to define blacks as good citizens, but also limits
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
participation and legitimacy of bad white citizens4. Good character is associated
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
with 1) dignity, 2) worthiness 3) restraint and 4) modesty. First, the rights project
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
used discourses of good black citizenship to define dignity in relation to public
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
recognition blacks can be trusted and counted one.     Good  black citizens
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
represented the American ideal, not bad whites.   By mastering personal ethical
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
practices, the black male:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
He came to feel that he was somebody. He came to feel that the important thing about a man is not the color of his skin of the texture of his hair, but the texture and quality of his soul. With this new sense of dignity and self respect a new Negro emerged. So there has been a revolutionary change in the Negro's evaluation of his nature and destiny (King [1958] 1986: 85-86).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
For blacks in the movement, mastering personal ethical practices organized a
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
new way of perceiving and interpreting political life. Good black citizens rejected
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
attributing race to abilities and capacity for success.  King noted that, "In the new
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
age we will be forced to compete with people of all races and nationalities.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
4 In order to secure political power, bad whites associated blacks with bad character to justify their exclusion from public life. In 1960, the Mississippi legislative passed a joint resolution to amend the 1890 Article XII of the Mississippi constitution to include a new qualification, good moral character, to the list of qualifications to vote (RS 1-10).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
68
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Therefore, we cannot aim merely to be good Negro teachers, good Negro
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
doctors, good Negro ministers, good Negro skilled laborers. We must set out to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
do a good job, irrespective of race, and do it so well that nobody could do it
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
better" (King [1957] 1986: 139).   Good black citizens strove to be the best in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
order to overcome boundaries and limits placed on them because of race.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Simply being a good black doctor implied that black doctors were inferior to white
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
doctors. It kept racial stereotypes attached to capabilities, skills and character.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to speeches and writings, the rights project defined a set of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
personal ethics in their published movement literature and pamphlets.    The
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
movement printed and distributed pamphlets to gain recruits, and network with
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
smaller autonomous movements at small black colleges and churches. We can
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
see one example of how the rights project used personal ethical practices in an
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SCLC pamphlet simply entitled "Why" to understand how they fashioned ideas of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
dignity and worthiness to black citizenship.   The pamphlet situated the life of a
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
fictional,  yet typical,  black family  into  a  crisis  narrative.     Crisis  narrative
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
"emphasizes not only the tragic distance between is and ought but also the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
possibility of heroic overcoming" (Jacobs 2000: 9).   Situated in a discourses of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
good black citizenship, the pamphlet used the crisis narrative to produce the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
normative idea of good black citizens trying to better themselves but cannot
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
because society denied blacks rights and opportunities. The story starts as:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Tommy is a bright intelligent little boy who lives in Alabama. There is no limit to the things Tommy could become and do in his lifetime. He could be a great scientist and build spaceships; he could be a businessman or a doctor; he could make enough money when he is older to give his own family a decent life. But the odds are against Tommy because he is a Negro (CC 3-2)
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
69
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The story presented the "Tommy" character as good black child full of potential
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and promise.  The story noted that occupations associated with high-status and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
high income could be his future.  Tommy has the abilities, and we presume that
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
he would be and is capable of working hard, to fulfill the 'American Dream' of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
moving  up the social  hierarchy.     The tragedy  is that Tommy's  ascribed
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
characteristics, black skin, will prevent him from ever reaching his potential.  A
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
fair desegregated democratic culture would not deny Tommy opportunities. The
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
narrative then incorporated Tommy's parents,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Tommy's parents love him, but they cannot see to it that he gets the education he will need...Tommy's mother and daddy are not lazy people; they want to work, but they cannot find jobs. Tommy's parents did not get the kind of education they needed to qualify for many jobs. Besides that, white people are hired first in Alabama, and Negroes only get the jobs that are left (CC 3-2)
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Tommy's parents defy stereotypes that black poverty is the result of bad personal
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
ethical practices.   Tommy's parents want to work, but they never received a
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
quality public education that would give them decent jobs.    They wanted to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
overcome their lack of education, but white employers would not even hire them,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
even for menial jobs, because they are black.    The "Mommy" and "Daddy"
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
characters appealed to  both  parents and  students of the  movement.     It
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
challenged the students to think - do you want to end up like your parents?  It
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
challenged the parents to think - do you not want something better for your
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
children? The narrative then defined Tommy as further victim of white violence:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Tommy's parents pay taxes, but the Alabama police are not used to protecting Tommy and his family. They are used to keeping them down. The police may beat and intimidate Tommy when he is older, and Tommy's parents will not be able to do anything about it (CC 3-2).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
70
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The  narrative  represented  Tommy's  parents  as worthy and  dignified  good
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizens.   They want to work hard and fulfill their basic citizenship participation
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
like paying taxes, joining voluntary associations and voting indicate ideals of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
republican good citizenship.   For blacks, however, the fulfillment of citizenship
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
duties did not produce and form of civic integration.   It is the idea that active
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizenship did, and would, not produce civic inclusion that the idea of mastering
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
deracialized techniques of self emerged as the new strategy to produce civic
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
integration.  This part of the narrative is targeting students and young people to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
give them a glimpse of a possible future.   Finally, the narrative presented the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
solution to the problem and ended the tragedy in the form of good citizenship and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
voting:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Voting is the answer! We cannot freely vote. Many of the Negroes' problems in Alabama are direct result of not having the right to freely vote. We have been told that he reason Negroes are poor, uneducated and in bad shape is because we are no good and lazy. Let's see what the real reason is. Join the Freedom Army" to solve these problem and vote (CC 3-2).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
By concluding the crisis narrative with voting, it refuted black stereotypes as
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
helpless victims, and portrayed good blacks as political agents capable of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
producing social change.   Thus, the fictitious story of Tommy and his parents
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
represented how the civil rights movement sought to disassociate race from good
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizenship.  The characters in the narrative represented blacks as good people,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
worthy of civic inclusion and rights, but denied opportunities to succeed.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Third, the rights project used discourses of good black citizenship to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
separate material products blacks used as a strategy to project social statues, in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
71
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
sought to replace it with associations of good character. Specifically, the rights product wanted blacks to practice self-mastery when consuming material projects. This had two implications. On the one hand, it emphasized the quality of ones character. On the other hand, self mastery of consumer products was a deracializing strategy that sought to limit flashy styles of dress in favor of more conservative fashion practices. We see the emphasis of good black personal ethics in the program for the "Mass Meeting Sponsored by Southern Christian Leadership Conference Program for Student Conference and Raleigh Citizens Association". SCLC designed this program, closer to a small pamphlet, for the conference that led to the formation of SNCC. Despite narratives of spontaneity to distinguish and collective identity from the adult, part of SNCC's commitment to nonviolence required mastering personal ethical practices that represented them as good black citizens. For instance, the program contained a picture of King on the front. Under the picture, the text says "International Proponent of first-class Christian Citizenship Through Intelligent Non-Violent Protest" (EB 5-9). The text in a box under the picture and headline indicated: "Sacrifice for Dignity. First class citizenship is more important that first class clothes. Give up something for Easter in order to support the students sit down protest and the drive for total freedom (EB 5-9). Mastering good black personal ethical practices meant refraining from pleasures of shopping for consumer or material items. However, it also meant refraining from the desire to by new clothes because it reflected bad black stereotypes. Dressing the body in respectable clothing distinguished blacks as good citizens. It contrasted to the flashy and extravagant
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
72
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
styles of dress that represented black stereotypes that blacks only cared about their appearance.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The rights project viewed personal ethics of self-restraint and modesty as important to being a good black citizen. Self-restraint meant carefully managing and controlling one's emotions in relation to abusive white police and white citizens, when handling the bombing or attack on ones home, family or friends, and the right way to integrate buses or schools. An important part of SNCC's sit-ins included mastering self-restraint in relation to verbal and physically abusive whites. Mastering affective response required careful attention and detail to one's conduct. The public display of anger represented blacks as irrational. The public display of arrogance represented blacks as bad citizens. The ritualized repetition of good black civic practice provided the clearest distinctions of blacks as good citizens.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In his book Stride Toward Freedom King tells the story of how his Montgomery home was bombed to illustrate how he mastered self restraint, and how mastering ones emotions was beneficial to the black movement. The Montgomery Bus boycott began to make both statewide and national headlines because of the prolonged black commitment to the boycott and the nonviolent style in which they protested. Eventually, members of or sympathetic to the Klan bombed King's house while King was giving a speech at a local mass meeting. His wife, two-year-old daughter and friends' wife were home at the time. King arrived home, only to find that the tensions between local blacks and whites were escalating. The risk of not controlling this situation meant at minimum a riot and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
73
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
potentially the end of the movement.   King depicted the scene in front of his
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
house:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
One Negro was saying to a policeman, who was attempting to push him aside: "I ain't gonna move nowhere. That's the trouble now; you white folks is always pushing us around. Now you got you '38 and I got mine; so let's battle it out.' As I realized that many people were armed. Nonviolent resistance was on the verge of being transformed into violence (King [1958] 1964: 90).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
At this point in the Montgomery Movement, King indicated it risked disintegrating
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
into violent racial factions.   The failure of the police to prevent the bombing is
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
important because the Montgomery Police Chief Clyde Sellers recently joined the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
White Citizens Council.  The bombing represented how bad whites used violent
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
practices to control and intimidate blacks.   Black residents had been exhibiting
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
nonviolent civic practices in the bus boycott, but they were not pacifists.5  King
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
argued his mastery over his emotions help prevent further violence:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In this atmosphere I walked out to the porch and asked the crowd to come to order. In less than a moment there was complete silence. Quietly I told them that I was all right and that my wife and baby were all right. 'Now let's not become panicky,' I continued. 'If you have weapons, take them home; if you do not have them, please do not seek to get them. We cannot solve this problem through retaliatory violence. We must meet violence with nonviolence.... Then I urged them to leave peacefully. "We must love out white brothers,' I said, 'no matter what they do to us. We must make them know that we love them (King [1958] 1964:90-91).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Despite the tension and anger, King's ability to regain order and 'quietly' address
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the crowd is significant.   In a situation where whites almost killed his family,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
coupled with gathering crowd, King addressed the onlookers in a calm and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
rational manner.  King did not shout, he did not curse, he did not yell, and by all
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
5 Many blacks owned guns for protection against bad whites.   Indeed, the pacifist Glen Smiley persuaded King to give up his gun as a commitment to nonviolence and not appear hypocritical.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
74
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
accounts, he did not cry. King's mastery over his emotions allowed him to exhibit
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
self-restraint.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The rights project trained Montgomery blacks in the art of self-mastery and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
self-restraint to ensure good  personal ethical practices when  preparing to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
integrate the buses. Additionally, they encouraged blacks to exhibit modestly by
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
regulating the style of conduct and manners blacks exhibited when ritually
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
boarding and choosing a seat on the bus.   First, the Montgomery movement
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
emphasized modesty:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
...we must not go back on the buses and push people around unnecessarily boasting of our rights. We must simply sit where there is a vacant seat... This places upon us all a tremendous responsibility of maintaining, in face of what could be some unpleasantness, a calm and loving dignity befitting good citizens and members of our race. If there is violence in word or deed it must not be our people who commit it (King [1958] 1964: 106).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Blacks were encouraged to board and sit on the bus as if nothing had changed.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
They were to follow the ritual without interacting with white riders who may
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
violently respond.   Managing one's conduct required consistency.   Good black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizens were modest in the bad and good times.   When it came time to boarding
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the buses, no one in the movement was sure how whites would respond. Would
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
they respond violently, would they boycott the buses? The movement decided to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
place black ministers on the buses because they felt their presence would give
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
blacks courage and make them less likely to retaliate if insulted by whites (King
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
[1958] 1964: 109).  In this sense, the presence of ministers provided a system to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
ensure and  support blacks exhibiting good  practices.     By practicing good
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
75
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
personal ethics, blacks ensured the American public that they were not provoking whites, but rather, were riding the buses as good citizens.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Prior to boarding the first integrated buses in Montgomery, the rights project designed a series of "general suggestions" and "specific suggestions" that instructed blacks on how to board the buses as good citizens. Movement organizers instructed blacks on how to board, sit and ride the buses through a series of workshops held at mass meetings.6 Here, I want to focus in how the rights project designed the suggestions around the idea of mastering personal ethical practice. Some of the suggestions read:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
4.   Demonstrate the calm dignity of our Montgomery people in your actions.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
5.  In all things observe ordinary rules of courtesy and good behavior. Remember that this is not a victory for Negroes alone, but for all Montgomery and the South. Do not boast! Do not Brag!
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
7. Be quiet but friendly; proud, but not arrogant; joyous, but not boisterous (King [1958] 1964: 106).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Good blacks practiced good manners and good character when riding the buses.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
They were to be calm and courteous when entering, sitting and riding.   There
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
was a consistent idea that blacks should refrain from public celebratory acts.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Bad citizens were ungrateful.    Good conduct also meant mastering affective
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
responses. Blacks did not want to appear arrogant, but they also did not want to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
appear apathetic.     By practicing  good  manners and  good  conduct when
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
integrating buses, blacks demonstrated that racial segregation was unfair while
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
reflecting idealized citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
6 The next chapter analyzes in depth how the rights and grassroots project trained the body to master a set of ethical practices that represented them as good black citizens
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
76
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
While the general suggestions served as guidelines, which outlined vague and abstract values of good conduct on how to board the buses as good citizens, the "specific suggestions" outlined the exact practices of how to choose a seat and how to handle an adverse situation with whites:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
3.  In sitting down by a person, white or colored, say 'May I' or 'Pardon me' as you sit. This is a common courtesy
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
4.  If cursed, do not curse back. If pushed, do not push back. If struck, do not strike back, but evidence love and goodwill at all times
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
5.  In case of an incident, talk as little as possible, and always in a quiet tone
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
6. For the first few days try to get on the bus with a friend in whose nonviolence you have confidence. You can uphold one another by a glance or by a prayer (King [1958] 1964: 107).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The specific suggestions illustrate the importance of mastering good manners
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and good character.   Good manners meant saying 'may I' and 'pardon' when
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
walking past another citizen.    The public display of specific well-recognized
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
manners ensured blacks would not be associated with black stereotypes of bad
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
behavior e.g. rude, uncivilized.  Additionally, the workshops instructed blacks to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
be "quiet" and not respond to bad whites.  Being quiet referred to not escalating
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
or making the worst out of a bad situation. If whites were verbally rude or hostile,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
a lack of response ensured no further problems. Conversations amongst friends
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
were to be of a quiet or modest level. Voices were never to be raised to a noise
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
level others would deem unpleasant.   Suggestion number six instructed blacks
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
ride the bus with a friend. Ministers rode the buses to provide guidance on good
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
conduct.     However,  friends  provided  an  immediate  and  intimate form  of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
surveillance.  Friendship provided a reciprocal relationship to inspect and ensure
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
good civic practices, as well as provide a witness to good conduct. As a witness,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
77
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
they could publicly testify that their friend was a good citizen in relation to bad
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
whites.  The surveillance practices of the friend reproduced good citizenship by
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
fixating ritualized good personal ethical practices while riding the buses.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to the suggestions on how to enter and sit on the bus as good
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizens, the movement printed flyers and distributed them to black riders who
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
could not or did not attend the training sessions at the mass meetings.   The
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Montgomery Movement produced the flyers with the dual reading public of black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
bus riders and whites who may object to integrating buses. The flyers read:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Negroes can now sit anywhere on Buses!
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Be first class citizens! It's now time to move up front! Ride first class for
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
first class fare - - Sit in any empty seat on buses!
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Remember: Be good Americans - be calm, be quiet, be friendly, be
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
prayerful  but be free" (EB 5-9).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The flyer explicitly associated the importance of personal ethical practices with
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
idealized good American citizens.   With instructions already established on the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
proper way to board, sit and ride the bus, this flyer cements the association of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
good civic conduct with idealized American citizenship. This flyer communicated
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
to Montgomery whites that blacks would not be involved in creating a public
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
spectacle of bus integration.   Rather, blacks would simply exercise their right to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
enter and sit on a bus like other good citizens who ride public transportation.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
King reported that blacks integrated the buses without incidence and that
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
most whites were respectful during this process.   One exception was a white
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
man who slapped a black woman in the face.  Unlike white man, King noted the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black woman practiced self-mastery over her affective response. "True, one
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Negro woman was slapped by a white man as she alighted, but she refused to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
78
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
retaliate. Later she said: 'I could have broken that little fellow's neck all by myself, but I left the mass meeting last night determined to do what Reverend King asked'" (King [1958] 1964: 110). Despite wanting to retaliate, she practiced self-restraint and deferred to the pedagogical practices that represented good black citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In sum, the rights project used discourses of good black citizenship to deracialize black personal ethical practices by shaping idealized bodily postures and affective response to produce a normative idea of good black citizenship. The ritualized repetition of good conduct deracialized associations of good character to ascribed racial status. King used the good black / bad white binary to demonstrate the race had no impact or determinant cause on what counted as good citizenship. Indeed, bad whites who continued to exhibit rude conduct towards blacks contributed to the idea that good citizenship could no longer be associated with white skin color. By mastering deracialized techniques of self, blacks in the movement forced whites to engage the question of what counts as good citizenship. Is it white mothers screaming obscenities? Is it dirty whites shuffling their feet, uttering obscenities and using large groups of other bad whites to intimidate blacks? Or is it the college educated, articulate, well dressed and disciplined blacks that represent good citizenship? Social Ethics and Good Black Citizenship
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to outlining which personal ethical practices for blacks to master, the rights project constructed a set of social ethical practices for blacks to master when engaging others. The importance of social ethical practices was to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
79
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
regulate how racial and gendered bodies could interact as equals in public by minimizing the use of racial stereotypes that interfered with equitable public relations. They used discourses of good black citizenship to define how blacks should minimize affective responses of fear or hatred in others. In the text, we see three relations 1) black-black, 2) black-white, 3) gender, emerge as the most important relations needed regulating. Regarding black-black relations, it was important to maintain a middle ground that distinguished the good black citizen from the Uncle Tom and Black Nationalist. Regarding the black-white relations, it was important for black to practice deracialized techniques of self that rejected black stereotypes, which facilitated racial and civic integration. For gendered relations, it was important to establish a male hierarchy between black men and black women that mirrored the broader gender hierarchy. However, it was also important to limit sexual relations between black men and white women because the rights project did not want to alarm or drive away sympathetic whites. Overall, the importance of regulating the gendered relations was an attempt to produce heteronormative black families that mirrored heteronormative white families in order to help the process of desegregation.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Once blacks' mastered personal ethical practices, they were to use them in all social relations. Overcoming black stereotypes was the biggest obstacle to mastering social ethical practices. Stereotypes are abstract generalizations that can potentially apply to any social group. Power works to attach harmful stereotypes to group identities. The civil rights movement targeted black stereotypes associated with bodily practices - blacks as lazy, dirty and prone to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
80
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
violence - as the point of resistance. Racializing strategies, more systematic in the south than other parts of America, put the onus on blacks to prove that black stereotypes were unfair and unwarranted. Economic and legal strategies did not creating changes in the south. Local white political elites did not enforce legal ruling like Brown v Board of Education that desegregated schools. White unions, who were not influential in southern politics to begin with, felt they were in competition with black workers and blamed blacks for low wages. Therefore, blacks alone shouldered the burdened and responsibility of refuting unfair stereotypes. King argued that the southern black man, "He has to win and to vindicate his dignity in order to merit and enjoy his self-esteem. He had to let white men know that the picture of him as a clown - irresponsible, resigned and believing in his own inferiority - was a stereotype with no validity" (King 1964: 31). Social ethical practices were important to master so as not to confirm black stereotypes in the eyes of whites.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
First, the rights project emphasized practicing deracialized techniques of self when interacting publicly with other blacks. They wanted blacks in the movement to distinguish themselves as good black citizens in relation to Uncle Toms and black nationalists. The idea of an Uncle Tom referred to blacks who gained increased social standing at the expense of other blacks. The movement identified Uncle Toms in local black communities as blacks who interfered with civil rights work. They avoided Uncle Toms because they harden black intra-group boundaries. Yet, the idea of black nationalism, especially ideas of racial separation and the use of violence as means for achieving equality, projected an
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
81
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
image of being 'too black' and anti-American. Being too black would harden racial boundaries between whites and blacks. The Uncle Tom was more problematic to blacks, while the black nationalist was more problematic to whites. The idea of the black nationalism was perceived as more harmful for the movement than the Uncle Tom because it had the potential to decrease white support for desegregation. By distinguishing themselves as good black citizens, the rights project represented a political position that stood in opposition to both white and black supremacy, and racial shame.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
For the rights project, the black nationalist project represented the opposite of idealized American citizenship, and thus, should be avoided. King argued the Nation of Islam, "is made up of people, who have lost faith in America, who have absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded that the white man is an incurable 'devil'" (King [1963] 1986a: 296-97). Although America has no official state relation, historically Christianity has implicitly functioned as the normal religion to religion. Not being Christian equated to not being a good citizen. Indeed, James Farmer argued that blacks should avoid and reject the bad civic practices of black nationalists because they are dangerous and unpractical, "With no real work to do in America, their advice to love blacks turns into a program to hate whites. Eager to act manfully, they can only imagine petty schemes of violence and revenge" (Farmer 1965: 106). Rather than improving race relations in America, black nationalists are more concerned with immediate pleasures of revenge. The pleasure associated with revenge is using violence as means of fulfilling immediate goals of getting even
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
82
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
rather than long-term goals of cultivating a better system of racial and democratic
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
equality.      Furthermore,   the   rights   project  viewed   the   black   nationalists'
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
separation, isolationist and violent practices as rejecting democratic public life.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Public life depends on some commonalities and associational life.   Hardening
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
racial boundaries inhibits public life and anchors blacks to the political margins.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In   contrast  to   hardening   racial   boundaries,   mastering   deracialized
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
techniques of self limited affective responses in whites.   Whites made reactive
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and irrational decisions because they feared blacks.  White political elites used
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the fear of blacks to initiate racialized legislation that shaped a southern idea of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
whiteness that unified a white population differentiated by geography, religion,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and class.   For example, a 1959 letter by former governor of Georgia Marvin
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Griffin (1955-1959) urged Georgia's whites that, "We must wipe the registration
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
slate clean every two years to keep from adding thousands of ineligible Negroes
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
each year... I know that you would much prefer this slight inconvenience to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
turning our state over to Negro domination.   This is the only way to protect
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
ourselves" (EB 5-1). Bad whites practiced a racially threatening technique of self
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
that encouraged bad black strategies that made black nationalism appealing to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
blacks.  King encouraged blacks to limit associations with black nationalism, but
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
he also notes how whites also needed to accept good black citizens as equals,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
And I am further convinced that if our white brothers dismiss as 'rabble rousers' and 'outside agitators' those of us who employ nonviolent direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies - a development that would inevitable lead to a frightening nightmare (King 1964: 91).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
83
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
If whites resisted the rights project's deracializing strategy into the American
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
polity, then blacks would seek out black nationalist alternatives.   Just as black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
racialized techniques of self produced affective responses in whites, racialized
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
whites practices discouraged blacks from practicing nonviolent and democratic
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
reform.   Bad white practices had the implications of igniting a race war.   Their
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
resistance to the rights project would only convince blacks that America would
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
never change. In contrast to bad whites, good whites preferred the alternative of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
minimizing racial conflict and supporting idealized American citizenship.   They
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
rejected all forms of racialized strategies in favor of civic inclusion based on what
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
counts as good citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Mastery of bodily postures and affective response created opportunities
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
for interracial cultural exchange. Interracial cultural exchange meant whites and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black agreeing on a public consensus of good not tied to or associated with
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
either race. King notes that:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Not long ago the Negro collegian imitated the white collegian. In attire, in athletics, in social life, imitation was the rule... Today the imitation has ceased. The Negro collegian now initiates grouping for unique forms of protests... Overnight, his white fellow students began to imitate him (King [1961] 1986e: 161).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The indication of whites imitating blacks does not refer to whites acting black.  It
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
refers to an idea of how some whites began acting like good citizens by
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
establishing external values of good citizenship not associated with  racial
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
hierarchies7.  Most important were white students adopting and supporting good
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
civic practices like sit-ins and nonviolent direct action. All over American college
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
7 King also presented the civil rights moved as political inspiration for American and European whites in relation to African independence movements and decolonialism
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
84
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
campuses, whites formed 'Friends of SNCC chapters to raise money and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
organize support for civil rights within the white community. Rather than copying
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
blacks,   we   should   understand   the   movement   as   stimulating   the   white
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
communities to support a deracialized American citizenry.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Finally, the rights project used discourses of good black citizenship to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
organize a normative claim of what counted as the good black man. The idea of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
good black man had two interrelated dimension.  First, the rights project defined
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
good black men as political agents who mastered masculine practices that
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
allowed them to care for their family, as a the black patriarch, which created a
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
hierarchy between black men and black women. Before black males can master
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
civic practices associated with the public sphere, they must first master head-of-
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
household practices associated with the private sphere.   The good black man
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
should be the head of the house, the breadwinner, and family decision maker.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The reasons behind shaping an idea of good black men with the familial patriarch
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
was that it associated black men with masculine ideals of adulthood, such as
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
strength   and   independence,  that  were  intertwined  with  good   citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Matriarchy violated the black man's ability to  practice self-mastery.     The
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
subordination of black men to black women not only undermines his masculinity,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
but by extension also undermines his capacity to be a good black citizen.  King,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
especially, associated matriarchy with cultural conditions that artificially elevated
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black women above black males:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
When a Negro man is inadequately paid, his wife must work to provide the simple necessities for the children. When a mother has to work she does violence to motherhood by depriving her children of her loving guidance and protection; often they are poorly cared for by others or by
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
85
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
none - left to roam the streets unsupervised... The Negro mother leaves home to care for - and be a substitute mother for - white children, while the white mother works (King [1958] 1964: 126-27).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
King argued that matriarchy interfered with the proper or 'normal' gender roles
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
intertwined  with  family  roles.  The  decline  of black  masculinity,   in  turn,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
strengthened white masculinity and the white family.   For King, black women in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the labor force mixed up gendered family roles, and led to the dissolution of black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
families.   For instance, black women frequently worked as 'domestics' fulfilling
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the roles of childcare and maid for white families in order for white men to enjoy
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
public life.  Black women neglected the care of black children at the expense of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
white children. Thus, the rights project used discourses of good black citizenship
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
to project an idealized black masculinity as part of their symbolic citizenship
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
claims.  Good black men exhibited the same masculine practices as good white
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
men.   The rights project used idealized masculinity to situated good black men
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and good white men with idealized meanings of citizenship, at the expense of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
bad black men and bad white men.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The second dimension of good black men was producing an idea of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
masculinity not centered on violence.  Besides convincing blacks that nonviolent
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
practices increased their chances of success, the rights project had to convince
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
blacks that nonviolence did not make them less of a man. The idea of accepting
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
beatings from white men, being spit upon, and berated with hostile language, all
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
violated  masculine  notions of strength  and  control.     King  notes that,  "...
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
nonviolent resistance means that you do resist in a very strong and determined
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
manner and I think some of the criticisms of nonviolence or some of the critics fail
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
86
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
to realize that we are talking about something very strong" (King [1963] 1986b: 336). King associated nonviolence with attributes of 'strength' and 'sophistication'. Good black men were 'man enough' to accept the tough and unpleasant challenges of changing the world the 'right way'. The right way was through nonviolence, which distanced blacks from America's violent past. In addition, affective self-mastery distanced black men from feminine associations. Good black men did not show emotions, such as wincing or crying, when hit. They did not act out 'hysterically' when whites cursed at or spit on them. Thus, affective mastery organized black masculinity by emphasizing masculine virtues of strength and limiting feminine practices of weakness.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In contrast to good black men, bad black men failed to master their emotions and desires, which associated black men with black stereotypes of violence and broken down black families. Black men who failed to care for their families, and instead choose to hang on street corners, drink excessive amounts of alcohol, gambled etc. represented blacks as bad citizens. For the rights project, the implications for black men that did not master deracialized techniques of self were the continued subordination to whites and civic integration. In part, the distinction between the private and public sphere, where women have cared for children and fulfilled domestic labor duties, has produced the idea of the autonomous and rational political agent. However, culturally, the idea of intact black heteronormative families represent the symbiotic aspects of the public and private sphere, in that mastering the domestic sphere adds an additional  aspect  of status  and   associations  of  being  "normal"  to  black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
87
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizenship.    Therefore, the rights project's symbolic citizenship claims relied
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
heavily on black men being good black men because black men were the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
dominant representation of good black citizenship, and therefore, the degree that
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
they exhibited norms of American masculinity helped align them with idealized
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
An important part of the rights projects normative claims of the good black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
men was how it contrasted black masculinity to black femininity, and created
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
boundaries between black men/black women, straight black men/gay black men.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The rights project understood black masculinity in relation to black femininity. The
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
rights project fashioned the idea black masculinity and black femininity around
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the black polity by instructing gendered family roles into the pedagogical
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
techniques of both their "citizenship schools" and "community centers".   The
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
community centers in particular sought to teach women how to be good mothers
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and good wives,  in order to attach them to the domestic sphere and the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
household.   Community centers offered instructional classes on nutrition (self
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and child), daycare services, as well as "Public healthcare such as prenatal and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
infant care, basic nutrition" (CC 1-1).  For men they offered classes on how to fix
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
up ones home. A CORE pamphlet asking for donations for their community
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
centers relied on ideas of idealized gender roles.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Recently, fabric for 110 dresses was sent by the IGWU's Local 23-25 to Mississippi. Many of the women who learned to sew by making a dress at the community center had not had a new dress for 4 or 5 years. Their involvement in the sewing class encouraged most of them to start voter registration classes (CC 1-1).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
88
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Good women learned how to be good wife and mother, through mastering
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
techniques like sewing, which represented them as good black women.   The
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
rights project used discourses of good black citizenship to attach them to a set of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
practices that had black women play 'second-fiddle' to black men.   Regulating
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black citizenship around a patriarch ideal of gender and American citizenship, in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
part, organized the mainstream civil rights movements symbolic citizenship
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
claims.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
However, black women in the movement resisted ideas that they
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
should function as good women and know their proper place as subordinates
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
(see Morris 1984: 114-115, Crawford et al 1993, Gyant and Atwater 1996).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Under Ella Bakers guidance, an unnamed young woman circulated a letter to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
other  members  of  SNCC  protesting  the  gendered   practices  of work
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
assignments,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
A fall 1964 personnel and resources report on Mississippi projects lists the number of people in each project. The section on Laurell, however, lists not the number of persons, but 'three girls... Average white person finds it difficult to understand why the negroes resents being called boy or being thought of as 'musical' or 'athletic' because the average white person doesn't realize that he assumes he is superior... So too the average SNCC worker finds it difficult to discuss the woman problem because of the assumption of male superiority (EB 5-9).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Similar to the utterance of 'boy' that whites used to marginalize black men, black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
women rejected black men' use of the   utterance 'girl' to reproduce a gender
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
hierarchy.   Black men protested, accepted blows and went to jail.   'Black girls'
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
answered phones and went on coffee runs.  Black women resisted because they
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
equated gendering citizenship with racializing citizenship.    While the rights
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
project was using discourses of good black citizenship to open space for equal
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
89
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizenship between men, they were doing it at the expense of black women. Black and white women's displeasure over how black and white men treated them inspired many women to later abandon struggles for racial equality and organize the women's movement of the early 1970's (Ferree and Hess 2000: 53-75).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
While little evidence exists of direct articulations of black masculinity in relation to hetero/homo binary, the silence on the subject speaks volumes. Queer theory challenged the idea that gender and sexuality are autonomous concepts (see Bulter 1990, Seidman 1999). That is, cultural images of the 'man' imply a heterosexual man. Good black citizens were not gay. The presence of a gay black man created a point of contestation within the movement. The movement felt that public knowledge of Bayard Rustin's sexual practices would be harmful to the movement (Morris 1984: 115, Garrow 1986: 69). Black political rival Adam Clayton Powell threatened to expose Rustin to the public to discredit SCLC unless King gave Powell input on intra-political matters (see Garrow 1986: 138-140). Roy Wilkins, president of the NAACP, also used Rustin's sexuality to undermine Rustin's work and decision-making over the March on Washington (Garrow 1986: 276). Despite personal contempt for Powell, King obliged and kept Rustin as a background advisor. Rustin worked primarily behind the scenes with white advisors Stanley Levison and Jack O'Dell, who were former members of the American communist party. Rustin obtained no leadership position in any black organization until he directed the A. Phillip Randolph Institute in 1965.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
90
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Besides defining the relations black men should have with black women, the rights project also defined the proper relations black men should have with black women. The most difficult social ethical practice to manage was interracial sexual and marital practices. Interracial marriage and sex represented asymmetrical power relations between races that overlapped the public and private sphere. Black men were to avoid all social and sexual contact with white women. The question of white males who engaged in sexual relations with black women differed. White male sexual overtures represented the lack of respect and the hypocrisy of whites not wanting to live or work with blacks but still willing to engage in sexual practices with them. Southern whites felt it was their right as white men to have sex with black women. This right was exclusive to white men. White women did not count in this equation. Each interracial sexual practice centered on the problem of the men. Women were victims or potential victims who needed protection from racialized sexual predators. The social position of black men in relation to white men also informed how each should manage interracial practices. Blacks had to contend with the threat and realities of murder. This meant blacks had to pay particular attention to their public practices around white women.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The use of interracial sexual practices was a topic the movement carefully managed. The movement could not reject interracial sex practices to appease whites because it would undercut their deracializing strategy. However, they also could not publicly condone interracial sexual practices because it would repel whites who supported equal rights but did not want their sons or daughters
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
91
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
sexually involved with blacks. The movement attempted to bracket the question of interracial sex from the discussion of good citizenship. There is no discussion of blacks and whites of good character and moral standing starting families and or even dating. The movement was neither for nor against interracial sex. They would only say that interracial sex and marriage was not part of the movements' goals. For example, in text produced by King and Farmer we find no definitive stance on the debate. On interracial marriage, King notes, "... the Negro's primary aim is to be the white man's brother, not brother-in-law" (King [1958] 1964: 128). Good blacks want to be neighbors, friends and fellow citizens, but they do not want to share a mixed race gene pool. Although James Farmer was critical of anti-miscegenation laws that prohibited interracial marriage (in 1965, nineteen states had such laws on the books) he sidestepped talk on interracial sexual practices by claiming that marriage and sexual practices were property of the private sphere: "And we are not advocating interracial marriage. I believe that such advocacy is as dirty-minded as the prohibition. One simply must not dictate to the human heart this way" (Farmer 1965: 127). Situated in the private sphere, states cannot regulate interracial sexual desires. Good citizens' sexual practices are personal matters not subject to regulation. Ideally, the private sphere provided the limit of limits of state intervention. Farmer assured critics that the movement did not advocate or encourage interracial marriages, nor would its practices encourage such endeavors.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The difficulty in managing interracial sex also reflected the asymmetrical racial-structural positioning between black men and white men.  The question of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
92
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
white men and black women differed from the question of black men and white women. For black men, it was a question of making white women publicly available. First, white men did not face the same threat of violence as black men. Second, the question of white men and black women was a sexual practice that represented practices of racial exploitation. For white men, it was a question of the hypocrisy of privately engaging in sexual relation while rejecting public forms of racial integration. Farmer noted that "Black women are for white men to have; white women are for no one to have. In a typical Southern town, every Negro knows of the whites who are kin to him" (Farmer 1965: 126). Here, the question of white men and black women is not a normative condemnation of interracial sexual practices, but of white men not being accountable for his actions. Fathering interracial children without acknowledging the children or the mother represented irresponsible and bad practices. Bad whites do not take care of their families like good citizens. They are secretive, dishonest and inconsistent. These same associations also represent bad white organizations like the Klan and white citizens' council. A special July 1964 issue of Jet magazine on the civil rights movement represented white male sentiments toward black women. A small article titled "Sex dominates white thought in Mississippi" writes "A white man (in Mississippi) admitted that he had kept a Negro mistress for thirty years but the indignity denied he favored 'social' equality'. As proof of this, he argued that he had 'never', he said hotly, 'sat down to breakfast with her" (RS 1-11). Here, the question is not that whites had interracial  sex with  black women.     It was  how they did  it.     Bad whites
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
93
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
differentiated sex from intimacy with black women the same way they would a prostitute.   Black women were objects for bad whites to use to satisfy a need, urge or desire. Sex was a practice that enforced racial hierarchies. Civic Ethics and Good Black Citizenship
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to defining personal and social ethical practices, the rights project also used discourses of good black citizenship to define civic ethical practices for blacks to master while protesting and making claims for rights. For the rights project, blacks had to master deracialized techniques of self when engaging the public for political reason. They used their deracializing strategy to produce a black political agent who could demonstrate, run for office and function as a government administrator. Therefore, rather than view strategy as a product of elite decision-making, this dissertation holds that the civil rights movement embedded strategy in discourses of good black citizenship. The rights project constructed civic practices that pitted the black body in social space dominated by bad whites. They emphasized the good black / white binary that distinguished blacks as idealized citizens. In order to do this, the rights project limited civil rights protest to four analytically distinct protest civic ethical practices -citizenship programs, boycotts, sit-ins, and marches - that prevented movement supporters from engaging in revolutionary and separation practices.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Despite the glamour of mass protests and direct action, the rights project spent the majority of their resources registering blacks to vote. They used public demonstrations only when federal and local governments refused to desegregate facilities and prevent blacks from registering to vote.   The rights project used
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
94
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
voter registration practices to attach blacks with idealized good citizenship. Good black citizens were active in their communities. Active citizenship is an ideal associated with practices to improve and make communities better by keeping democratic leaders honest and accountable8. Through their citizenship schools and leadership training sessions, the rights project trained movement activists on how to exhibit personal and social ethical practices, e.g. good bodily postures, when active in the community. Good bodily postures included how to listen to local black complaints for what they said, and more importantly, what they did not say. It meant learning how to speak clearly, so others could understand, as well as the subject of conversations. Mastering personal and social ethics practices ensured blacks exhibited good black citizenship when engaging in political action.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
When voting could not create social change, the civil rights movement used direct action. Rustin was the main architect for nonviolent direct action. He urged SCLC to utilize direct action techniques because blacks could demonstrate locally to impact national citizenship (Garrow 1986: 85-86). This strategy differed to both the legal strategies of the NAACP and the revolutionary strategies of groups like the Nation of Islam. Roy Wilkins distanced the NAACP from direct action because he felt that it associated blacks too much with the labor movement of the 1930s, and early NAACP attempts at marching did not change much (see Fairclough 1987: 65). The NAACP represented black political practice that placed the responsibility for social change solely on black elites. Although some scholars consider SNCC's grassroots project more radical than 8 On active citizenship as a public ideal see Lister 1997
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
95
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SCLC because of their commitment to participatory democracy and independence from black church leadership, SNCC too emphasized public protest practices. Because the rights project and grassroots projects goals were civic inclusion, they could enter into working relations with one another, but not the Nation of Islam or black power groups.9
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Direct action was an intimate strategy to improve the immediate conditions of racial violence because it placed the body at the point of power/resistance. Blacks used the body to deracialize citizenship by changing how the body experienced pain. Blacks felt and experienced white domination through the body. Death by lynching was a physically brutal and symbolic form of social control. The body of the lynched experienced the pain of torture as whites sought to inscribe racial power through violence. Whites hung black bodies from trees for other blacks to view. Emotionally, blacks feared sudden and unjustified attacks. Black bodies experienced pain and violence through auditory sensations, especially bad whites cursing and berating of blacks during protests and marches. The body is also how blacks experienced and interpreted poverty. Black southern poverty meant cold winter homes that were not equipped with heat and windows. Malnourished bodies, stemming from poor carbohydrate rich diets and the demands of physical agricultural labor, marked black embodiment. All of the movement's direct action protest techniques required the immediate use and transformation of bodily practices.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
To elaborate, in the 1950s Robert Williams organized an NAACP chapter based on armed self-defense, and was subsequently excluded from the national NAACP office, as well as the Montgomery Improvement Association.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
96
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The bodily techniques of nonviolent direct action were limited to three practices. First was the use of boycott. Tarrow (1998) described boycotts as modern repertoires because they are nonviolent. Boycotts could be selectively unleashed against specific adversaries. They were flexible in that they could protest local bus segregation or regionally based chain stores that did not buy from black businesses. Good citizens used boycotts because they indicated inclusion into the existing moral order. Rather than destroy present social institutions, boycotts applied pressure on institutions to change their exclusionary practices. Boycotts were a technique to improve how social institutions valued and treated blacks. The Montgomery Bus Boycott improved the spatial ordering of black bodies in pubic space. The placement of black bodies in the rear of the bus in relation to white bodies in the front, or forcing blacks to stand while whites sat, devalued black bodies and reproduced a racial social ordering. The deteriorated physical conditions of buildings that served as all black schools, or the decrepit public facilities all served to fixate bodily interpretation, through visual and auditory senses, that blacks were inferior and deserved civic exclusion.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The second civic practice was the march. The march represented a tradition of protest where activists express dissent through the public exhibition of bodies in public. It mattered less how much the movement marched or how many people marched. The effectiveness of a march was the style of marching and the conduct of the marchers. For instance, SCLC outlined how protesters should  march to the courthouse or registrars office,  "persons visiting  the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
97
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
registrars office should do so in groups from 5-10. This will enable us to have witnesses in the event there are incidents relating to voter registration... We should send over our best persons first. Meaning persons we feel are reasonably qualified" (SCLC Part 4 Reel 1). For the rights project, the march, if properly executed, were effective at establishing the good black / bad white binary. A march comprised of good black citizens not reacting to the white mob's jeers projected the idea of good black citizenship throughout the dominant public sphere, and helped the overall civil rights movement gain supporters and allies.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The third protest practice was the sit-in. Similar to boycotts, sit-ins were flexible. Besides the lunch counter sit-ins, movement activists used swim-ins in hotel pools to protest segregated hotels, and stand-ins to protest segregated movie theaters. For instance, a SNCC produced test that instructed embryonic grassroots political cells how to apply the sit in model to a theatre protest, "A line of students forms at the ticket window, and, one by one, each person asks to purchase a ticket. Upon refusal, the person goes to the end of the line, which will continue to revolve in this manner."10 The advantage of using a sit-in over a boycott was that citizens could get their point across with just a few bodies. The Nashville students only needed 91 students to create an image of unjust and unfair treatment by whites. Effective boycotts demand the commitment of large groups of people mastering consumption practices over time. Unlike citizenship schools and community centers, sit-ins did not require large-scale networking, organization or resources. King noted the vast potential of social change through sit-ins, "Thousands of courageous students, sitting peacefully at lunch counters, 10 SAV 48-8 "SNCC - February First Freedom Day Action"
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
98
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
can do more to arouse the administration to positive action than all of the verbal
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and written commentaries on governmental laxity put together" (King [1961]
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
1986a: 159).   Sit-ins produced images of the unjust ways whites handled and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
treated blacks.   It also demanded a different kind of commitment than boycotts
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
because bodies were the site of violence.    The rights project and SNCC's
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
grassroots project trained bodies how to absorb a blow, how to 'deaden' ones
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
weight, while maintaining a good black presentation of self.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The rights project used discourses of good black citizenship to regulate
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
how direct action civic practices were fashioned in relation to local geopolitical
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
adversaries. The strategy to deracialize American citizenship worked best when
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
they could use the good black / bad white binary on the local level to induced
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
federal response.   Despite the variation of protest techniques, they all required
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the mastery of bodily postures and affective response in relation to bad whites.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
For example, CORE instructed the students involved in the sit-ins how to protect
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
their bodies.  For males, they were to "kneel down and arch over, with skull and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
face protected" while females were "to prevent internal injury from kicks, lie on
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the side and bring the knees upward to the chin" (quoted in Zinn [1965] 2002:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
24).  Protecting the body to minimize pain limited the possibility for an emotional
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
or violent outburst.  The students brought instructions on how to exhibit a good
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
bodily presentation of self, which included the following instructions:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Don't strike back or curse if abused, Don't laugh out, Don't hold conversations with floor workers. Don't leave your seats until your leader has given you instruction to do so. Don't block entrances to the stores and the aisles. Show yourself courteous and friendly at all times. Sit straight and always face the counter" (quoted in Oppenheimer and Lackey 1965: 81).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
99
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to a style of dress, mastering good bodily postures and affective responses also distinguished the students as good citizens. The students used public recitations of good citizenship practices to remind them to exhibit good civic practices. By publicly articulating that they would not reciprocate the violence and bad behavior of whites, the students made sure that larger publics could read the distinction between good black and bad white civic practices.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Besides pitting groups of protests versus bad white business practices, we have to understand how protest techniques also took place in geopolitically defined spaces. Part of situating the good black / bad white binary was selecting local geopolitical cultures and public figures that best represented bad white citizenship. They choose regions associated with 'predictable' bad white adversaries, like Birmingham and Selma, but also in relation to social space and dates in American History that associated the movement with idealized citizenship. The students staged sit-in at restaurants connected to city, county or federal government buildings (Zinn [1965] 2002: 27). This included a sit in at the lunch counter of the Montgomery City Courthouse (EB 5-1). It also meant protesting in spaces that were associated with the states national beliefs and values. In the recorded minutes of an SCLC meeting held in Atlanta July 2 &amp;amp; 3, SCLC directed protest strategy in an "Attempt to make use of the symbolism inherent in such historical days as: December 15th (bill of rights day) September 17th (Constitution Day), and July 4th (Independence Day)" (EB 5-2). By choosing historical dates, good citizen practices fixated American ideals of democratic
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
100
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
rights and equality to the movements' goals.   It also had the dual purpose of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
displacing bad white groups from doing the same thing:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
It would be good to have a number of mass meetings held in the south on July 4th. As it stands we usually celebrate this date with picnics and other entertainment, and the only group memoralizing the date, is the 'daughters of the American Revolution" who by no means can be called progressive. The movement for freedom in the South should make use of these symbolic dates in American history, as a means of dramatizing the unfinished business of democracy. (EB 5-2)
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Bad whites used an identical strategy of staging group performances to link them
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
with idealized American civic virtue.   By fashioning strategy in relation to both
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
bad whites and special dates in American history, the movement forced on
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
looking publics to ask the question, 'which group exhibits idealized citizenship'?
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
CONCLUSION
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
This chapter has argued that the rights project used discourses of good
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black  citizenship  to  produce  a  normative  ideal  of the  black  citizen  that
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
represented  idealized American citizenship.     They defined  a technique of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
deracialized self that represented the normative idea of the good black citizen.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Deracializing strategies required disassociating ascribed attributes of race (skin
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
color) as both a determinate and casual factor in favor of achieved statuses
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
linked  to  idealized  American  citizenship.     We  can  isolate  two  important
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
implications the rights projects outlined for why blacks should adopt deracialized
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
techniques.   First, they challenged and undermined bad whites' basis of power
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and authority.   The rights project understood that integrating into the American
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
polity without fundamentally altering what counted as good citizenship because it
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
would have resulted in token forms of integration without providing blacks with
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
101
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
any real power or means of improvement. The second implication was that deracializing good citizenship and replacing it with universalistic claims of good American citizenship excluded citizens based on bad citizen practices, such as violence and discriminatory practices. In part, this was a radical critique on American democracy, which argued for the self-suppression of racial and class identities for the benefit of the larger civic polity.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Displacing race as a marker of good citizenship placed more responsibility on blacks to master an interrelated set of normative ethical practices - personal, social and civic. The rights project used discourses of good black citizenship to define a set of personal ethical practices, which included a way of walking, talking, dressing and dialect that represented blacks as good citizens. They also defined a set of social ethical practices to govern how blacks should have relations with whites, with other blacks, and the gendered relations between black men and women, as well as black men and white women. It was important for black to master personal ethical practices in order to have good relations with others. For blacks, practicing good manners and dignity minimized emotions while discussing and debating political matters with whites and other blacks. Regarding black social ethical relations with whites, good manners helped debunk black stereotypes that blacks were not ready or capable of engaging in civilized democratic discourse. Regarding black relations with other blacks, good manners and dignity distinguished the idea of good black citizenship from either black political extremes of the black nationalist and Uncle Tom. Since black men were the dominant representations of blacks in public, the onus was on them to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
102
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
gain mastering over the domestic sphere, by caring for the family as the patriarch, because it helped align good black men with norms of American masculinity.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The third set of ethical practices, civic ethics, referred to how blacks were to master their personal and social ethical practices while represented blacks politically, which included demonstrating, making media appearances, voting, or running for/holding political office. While the black nationalist project defined a similar set of personal and social ethical practices, albeit to produce an idea of authentic black citizenship in hopes of creating black sovereignty and keeping whites away rather than racial and civic integration, they challenged the rights project most directly over what counted a civic ethical practices. For the rights project, good civic practices allowed blacks to establish the good black / bad white binary that induced federal legislation. The black nationalist project was more concerned about gaining control, governing, and caring for segregated black communities who found themselves in destitute situations. Therefore, demonstrating to invite federal legislation or protection, for the black nationalists, was not going to help the black community as much as building up independent black economic and political power. As I show in chapter 4, the differences in civic ethics represent the differences in political ideas, citizenship models, and strategies for producing racial equality.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Overall, how the rights project produced the normative idea of good black citizenship illustrated the importance of how social movements make symbolic citizenship claims, and the importance of culture in how we understand the power
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
103
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
of the dominant ideas of good citizenship. Prior ideas of good citizenship and how social movements make claims for citizenship have assumed that good citizenship was based on fulfilling a host of duties, such as paying taxes, joining the military or being publicly active, that do not consider the difficulty of how movements deal with racialized citizenship discourses. For the entire civil rights movement, the importance of existing idealized categories of good American citizenship, in the form of a discourse of rights and responsibilities, is how they structure and shaped the form and articulation of an alternative to racialized citizenship. Good citizenship represented ideas of mastering good civic practices as a technique of resistance. Resistance did not mean blacks 'speaking truth to power' or overcoming white hegemony. These ideas of resistance accompany modern assumptions of progress through resistance. Abandoning assumptions of progress, resistance is complex concept that cannot assume that the negation of an adversary, or other, equates to something better or something different. In the case of the rights project, blacks found more opportunities for social change when appealing to idealized American civic culture. Resistance meant emphasizing (or conforming to) idealized American values as much as it meant displacing race as the definitive marker of citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In this respect, we cannot hope to understand how the movement made demands or claims for new rights without analyzing how the movement sought to shape an ideal of good citizenship into good bodily practices. We cannot assume that abstract transformations in economic, political or organizational structures produced new types of citizens or improved conditions that made the civil rights
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
104
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
movement possible. The body was the site of resistance because the body is something that blacks could control. The movement shaped the body to fix interpretations and judgments about how to respond and carry on as good citizens and limit the extent they exhibited bad civic practices. Next, I analyze how the movement situated pedagogical techniques of good civic practice in a discourse of good black citizenship. As we will see, the movement trained activists how to exhibit good black normative ethics in relation to mastering bodily posture and affective responses that represented blacks as good citizens.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
105
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
CHAPTER 3: BODY, PRACTICE AND AFFECTIVE RESPONSE
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The rights project used discourses of good black citizenship to define a set of ethical practices that represented blacks as good citizens. Civil rights volunteers were responsible for a detailed care of the self, an art of mastering their bodily postures and affective response that associated blacks with idealized American citizenship. This chapter explains how the rights project used discourses of good black citizenship to organize their pedagogical techniques that trained civil rights activists how to master deracialized techniques of self. The pedagogical techniques shaped the body, as a political object, in both 'bodily ascetics' and external bodily regulation11. The rights project instructed blacks how to master external bodily postures and demeanors. Regulating the external body also included a discursive element of 'emotional work' that instructed the body how to react to and manage bodily pleasures. The internal discursive element, or 'bodily ascetics', was mastering the art of self-restraint in relation to violent and abusive adversaries. Through "role-playing", activists simulated interactions with bad whites in order to practice holding their temper. This meant learning to accept physical contact and verbal abuse without response. Training the body also fixed cognitive interpretation by teaching lessons on what should count as good citizenship. For instance, community centers intertwined ideas of a proper diet and a gendered ethic of taking care of the home (children and physical structure) with good citizenship. The citizenship schools used good handwriting lessons to shape a civic vocabulary to fashion a liberal, deracialized, rights orientated interpretation of political events. 11 See Turner (1996) for an extended discussion between the internal body and external body
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
106
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
I analyzed four movement programs, the rights projects "citizenship schools" and "role-playing" exercises, and SNCC's grassroots projects "leadership training", "freedom schools" and "community centers". Scholars have conducted little research on the movement's citizenship schools, community centers, and workshops. Most researchers either indicated that these programs existed (Lewis 1970), debated the merits of how effective they were at registering blacks to vote (Garrow 1986), explained them as illustrations of the overall organization of the movement (Morris 1984), or their importance for constructing the movement identity (Carson 1994, Eyerman and Jamison 1998). However, there exists no cultural-historical analysis that situates the programs within the histories of the larger political projects, or how and why the body became the target of the training. I organized the chapter by movement program rather than temporal sequence to highlight how each program taught personal, social and civic ethical practices. The data and materials for this chapter came from archival sources. Of special importance are the training manuals that outlined specific guidelines on what counted as good black civic practice. Next, I will provide a history and overview of how and why SCLC developed citizenship schools to replace voter registration drives. FROM VOTER REGISTRATION TO CITIZENSHIP SCHOOLS
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
After desegregating the buses in Montgomery, SCLC's initial citizenship drives form 1958 to 1961 focused on voter registration. Throughout 1959, the movement mobilized blacks based on the idea of challenging the restrictions on black voter registration.   For example, the United Christian Movement, a local
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
107
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
affiliate of SCLC in Shreveport Louisiana, sent mass letters to black residents on a "citywide voter drive" urging blacks to "Please contact at least one person and urge him to register Thursday March 19" and that "we will all go to the Caddo Parrish Courthouse together" (EB 5-1). Baker reported the outcome of "250 persons crowded the Caddo Parish Courthouse in an attempt to register. Only 46 persons were interviewed that day, and only 15 registered" (EB 5-2). What we see here is two obstacles that SCLC encountered. First, they underestimated southern whites' ability to maintain restrictions on black voter registration. Second, SCLC recruited from the professional, or elite, segment of the black population, which limited the number of blacks who attempted to register at one time, making it difficult to mobilize a large numbers of protesters at a given geopolitical location.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The "Crusade for Citizenship" was the first post-Montgomery program that introduced the idea of training blacks to master civic ethical practices. The initial 1958 memorandum stated the Crusade intended "to set up voting clinics and workshops in local communities. There is a concrete job for you to do - giving out leaflets, or going with a friend to register, or visiting your neighbors, or helping people in your block learn how to fill out registration forms" (EB 5-1). It was the idea of setting up workshops and clinics that made the Crusade significant. The workshops and clinics represented a community wide or 'collective effort' to train blacks on the techniques of voting. It involved producing text (leaflets) to pressure reluctant blacks to register, as well as formal and informal instruction on correctly performing the actual ritual of voting.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
108
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Setting up workshops and clinics involved logistical and practical difficulties. They included questions of where the workshops and clinics should be set up, who should run them, and the existing literacy skills of prospective volunteers and students. Baker gave the following observations at the SCLC meeting in Columbia, South Carolina: "Some people most interested in trying to vote are those unable to read and write. Churches should have committees each Sunday to help these people. Other organizations such as masons, sororities, etc. should render assistance. 'Citizenship schools' to help people learn to read and write is the need of the day" (EB 5-1). Her recommendation was to use the black church and other voluntary organizations and to assist in the training. In part, this emphasized the collective effort in shaping good citizenship techniques. Yet, the importance of Bakers proposed modifications was the recognition that even with the legal right to vote, blacks would still have to disassociate black stereotypes from ideas of good black citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
While SCLC was hesitant to implement Baker's reforms, workshops on nonviolence, which the Montgomery Movement used to prepare blacks on how to enter and ride the buses, continued to spread throughout the black south. They included the first nonviolent workshop held at Spellman College in Atlanta in July 1958 attended by 65 people hailing from 16 states (EB 5-2). September 23-24 in Jackson, Mississippi, James Lawson led workshops and discussion on nonviolence with about 25 ministers and black community leaders (EB 5-2). Lawson was the key figure who trained the Nashville students on nonviolent sit-in protest techniques that spread throughout the south in 1961.   What separated
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
109
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the workshops from the voter registration drive was the pedagogy and idea of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
mastering bodily practices.   Lawson's workshops combined lecture, discussion
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and role-playing (see below).    He believed blacks could master civic ethical
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
practices through repetition.  Repetition was 'simulating' or rehearsing scenarios
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
that placed blacks in social situations that necessitated the mastery of bodily and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
affective responses.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Baker gathered information from key authoritative sources on why adult
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
education was important for good black citizenship.   The idea of educating and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
training citizens was not acquiring literacy skills.    Rather, it was to negate
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
associations   of   bad   character   attached   to   illiteracy.       Baker   initiated
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
correspondences with the Federal Department of Education, Health and Welfare
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
in October 1959 to obtain suggestions on the best way to incorporate adult
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
education   into  the   citizenship   schools.      Edward   W   Brice,   Specialist   in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Fundamental and Literacy Education responded first by linking the lack of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
education with bad civic practices,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
There is some evidence of correlation between the educational level of people in the community and their participation in civic and public affairs. We believe there is some relationship between the educational level of the people in our predominately-southern states and their registration for voting purpose (EB 5-1).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Without the literacy skills and implicit socialization of educational institutions,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Brice viewed blacks as lacking necessary skills associated with good citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
More important than linking illiteracy to poor civic practice, Brice used poor civic
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
skills to make a normative argument, "These under educated Americans become
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
hostile, bitter, socially inhibited, cheated in life, with a strong guilt sense over in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
110
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
abilities and limitations. They are prejudiced, superstitious, unwanted" (EB 5-1).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The article mentions both white and blacks, but blacks were the subject of this
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
utterance.   Bad black citizens were hostile and bitter.   Good citizen pedagogy
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
required improving the ethical shortcomings signified with illiteracy and limited
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
educational accumulation.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Brice indicated to Baker that proper training could correct bad ethical
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
practices that represented bad citizenship.    Brice suggested an educational
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
program that "would have as its keystone 'development through enlightenment'"
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
(EB 5-1).   Development through enlightenment meant pedagogical techniques
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
"... to secure for our masses basic literacy such as: occupational literacy, social
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
literacy, civic literacy, personal literacy, which are so necessary for a survival and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
extension  in the world social order" (EB 5-1).     Good citizenship required
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
mastering a set of ethical practices that carried over to all aspects of public life.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Personal ethical practices, such as good conduct and good character were
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
equally useful at the ballot box, in the streets or at work.   Before blacks could
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
enter public life, they had to rid themselves of the practices that represented
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black stereotypes.   Baker's handwritten note on the back of letter from Brice
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
illustrated the movement's developing ideas of good citizen pedagogy,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Compared with 1927, residential illiteracy = more than now - 1959. No longer sheer illiteracy - broad view giving them tools with which to achieve fuller living. How can a process of change to draw upon resources of people_____as they attempt to satisfy_____. (EB 5-1)
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Baker ceased defining good citizenship in relation to quantified ends (number of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
voters, number of illiterate) in favor of the qualitatively defined set of standards.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Good black citizenship required teaching blacks the art of mastering personal,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
111
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
social and ethical practices exhibited through the body as symbols of idealized citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Baker moved to intertwine the voter registration efforts with a broader program organized around the pedagogical techniques of good black citizenship. In SCLC's Report of the Executive Director12, Baker writes, "the framework for a program of crusade proportion has been provided. The question is, are we ready to add substance to this frame" (EB 5-2). Then, in the following report of the Executive Director13, Baker argued, "The real value of SCLC would be that more people would be equipped with the basic tools (reading and writing) and would then be ready for effective social action" (EB 5-2). It was not enough to register blacks to vote. Baker argued the movement should set up a citizenship school to instruct deracialized techniques of self, and increase the number of nonviolent workshops.14 More importantly for Baker, "the literacy project could provide a 'respectable' channel for helping the cause without too close identification with more militant aspects of the struggle" (EB 5-2). The citizenship schools would link the movement to an idealized method of creating social change.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Despite Bakers urging, it was not until SCLC incorporated the Highlander citizenship school model did the civil rights movement implement systematic programs on the art of mastering good civic practices. Three reasons explain why SCLC switched to citizenship school model in 1961. First, the NAACP already fought legal exclusions, like poll taxes, literacy tests and segregation, so
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
14 The first citizenship schools were also referred to by 1961 by SCLC executive Wyatt Walker as leadership training (WF 29-12)
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
112
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SCLC wanted to distinguish their political project. Second, the movement began to ask questions of how blacks would vote. Was the black vote susceptible to being 'bought' by whites? Did blacks know how to practice the ritual of voting, including reading the ballots and finding the polling places? Voter registration did not prepare blacks on how to be good citizens. Third, and most important, SCLC viewed rural blacks as lacking the necessary skills to be individual and independent black political agents. Part of the strategy to deracialize good citizenship was the idea that black and white Americans were part of a broader idealized American nationhood. It was to break individual identification with racial groups and shape and identity around an idea of good citizenship. Therefore, the cultural change that distinguished SCLC's political project from other black political projects accompanied a different set of questions about racial equality and social change. To expand deracializing political project required a mechanism for instructing ethical practices that represented blacks as idealized American citizens for blacks and whites to emulate. The Highlander Model
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SCLC formed their citizenship schools only after they incorporated the Highlander Folk School model. Highlander had a history of involvement with civil rights activities. Rosa Parks attended the school, and Highlander proprietor Myles Horton attended the first SNCC meetings (EB 5-1). Baker noted that Highlander enjoyed past success in training "functional illiterate" blacks on citizenship practices. Septima Clark, the first citizenship schoolteacher on St. John's Island in South Carolina, focused on practical techniques that local
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
113
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
residents found pleasurable, like learning to write their name and filling out mail order forms, in order to encourage voter registration. As Baker was leaving SCLC to become an advisor to SNCC, SCLC obtained Highlander's citizenship files and programs (see Garrow 1986: 150-151, Glen 1988, Horton 1989).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The Highlander model is significant for influencing how the movement selected teachers, spatially and temporally organized the classes, and presented pedagogical material. It provided the skeletal outline that organized subsequent movement programs. In contrast to voter-registration drives, the Highlander model systematically defined a pedagogical process of teaching the art of good citizenship. For instance, Highlander's 1960 summer program defined its uses for "civic leaders who need to learn how to interest people in voting; also for prospective voters who need to learn how to register, how to mark a ballot, how to use a voting machine, how to vote wisely, and how to use new federal laws on civil rights" (SCLC 4-2). Located in the files of the SCLC are the files Highlander transferred to SCLC. Of special importance is the "Proposed Citizenship School Training Program" from December 1960. SCLC modeled their subsequent citizenship school proposals verbatim from this document. The only modifications were replacing the name "Highlander" with "SCLC" and differences in the set up of a "typical day".
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The model specified how to develop authority figures (supervisors and teachers), the spatial organization, and the temporal workings of the school. Supervisors and teachers had different responsibilities. Supervisors were the main authority figures, responsible for managing each 'area' or aspect of the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
114
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
school. The suggested ratio of supervisor to teacher was 1:10 (SCLC 4-2). They were responsible for knowing the intimate local cultural details, including its history of race relations, the form of the local municipal government, and willingness of the black population to get involved with the civil rights movement. Local cultural knowledge was information on the "best time of year, best time of day, best place for a meeting, what are local voting requirements, what makes registration difficult" (SCLC 4-2). The supervisor's knowledge guided each semi-autonomous citizenship school by defining: "(1) the different needs in different communities under their supervision, and (2) to judge the level of citizenship experience among the students, (3) to organize and administer schools and coordinate schools in the area and (4) to supervise teachers" (SCLC 4-2). Supervisors embodied local cultural knowledge, which provided the basis for judgment and evaluation of the teachers and students progress. While all citizenship schools worked with the same materials, supervisors had the authority to run the schools in relation to the distinctive needs of the local geopolitical community.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In contrast to supervisors, teachers were responsible for managing the classroom. Highlander recommended selecting teachers based on their knowledge of the local culture and positioning in social networks. "The teacher is a person living in the community. He may be a teacher by profession, a minister, a businessman or woman, a tradesman, a beautician, or any person qualified by demonstrated skill and responsibility and concern..." (SCLC 4-2). Teachers were selected in relation to their social standing in the local black community.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
115
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Selecting individuals who were already professionals ensured the presence of teachers who embodied a good black self. Since the teachers had more face-to-face contact with students, it was important that they exhibited idealized bodily mannerisms. Professional jobs accompany a style of dress and deracialized technique of self the rights project wanted blacks to emulate. The teachers' bodily presentation would have served as the 'hidden curriculum' that good citizenship was about more that literacy.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Highlander also provided a guide for "leadership training for a six week course one night a week" (SCLC 4-2) that supplied specific techniques on the training and development of leaders. For example, the first meeting made sure all teachers could answer the following questions: "Do you know the facts about your city, county or town? Organizations? Services for underprivileged and handicapped? "How can Negroes get these services?" Welfare - Health - Mental illness, orphan, blind, deaf, dumb". It was important to know the facts about each locale because not all southern locales had a municipal government. A mayor and common council headed some governments, while a mayor, commissioner, and common council ran others. Subsequent voter registration and protest strategy differed depending on government structure. The organizations of interest were primarily the NAACP, and their relation with (if any) local civil rights groups. SCLC judged the desirability of local knowledge in relation to care the body, especially medical and welfare services that could provide immediate improvements. The accumulation and mastery of local knowledge defined the quality of each local leader, supervisor and teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
116
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Highlander suggested carefully managing the spatial configurations and daily temporal rhythms to limit tensions and hierarchies within the classroom. Ideally, classes should be between 25-35 students. The spatial configurations of the classroom organized bodies in a non-hierarchical way. Although teachers enjoyed some flexibility on how they tailored good citizenship pedagogy to the students' capabilities, they were restricted from lecturing. Adult students experienced the role of student, signifying child, as demeaning - especially if teachers were younger - and were prone to drop out. Classes should focus on 'hands on' and practical assignments - like name writing and filling out applications. Therefore, the emphasis of group participation, in particular, meant not ordering bodies in the classroom with teachers lecturing in front of a class separated into neat vertical rows. In contrast, group participation meant dividing students "into small groups... to discuss their special problems and to have individual and group instruction on how to deal with them in local citizenship classes" (SCLC 4-2). The organization of bodies into small groups encouraged students to identify local problems, while the schools worked on instructing on how interpret their perceptions and provide the 'right' solutions to their problems.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Highlander structured the temporal organization of each day to strengthen collective bonds and fashion a good black identity. Highlander suggested dividing the day between formal instruction in the morning and afternoon, and informal instruction at night. Students were expected to attend both formal classes and informal sessions. The first classes, or "general sessions" should take place between 9-10:30 am.   The formal sections taught good handwriting,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
117
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
good listening and speaking skills (see below). Late night sessions between 8-10 pm were for "group singing, informal talk and recreation" (SCLC 4-2). This is when students learned freedom songs, such as "We Shall Overcome". The body ties together the relationship between time and space. While the two sessions instructed techniques of deracialized self, it was important for students to develop a bodily rhythm that put all students 'on the same page'. For example, participation in mass protest required singing in unison and marching at a controlled pace. The movement used singing and marching to discipline the body when confronting violent whites. It ensured that the protests appeared orderly and nonviolent, which insulated the movement from the press dismissing the protests as amateurish (see below).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SCLC made three adjustments to the Highlander model. The first two changes were made in relation to administering the pedagogy - who should ideally teach the classes, and how to incorporate workshops. SCLC saw the selection of the right teachers (or leaders) that represented good black citizens as "prime importance to the overall effectiveness of the program" (SCLC 4-2). The right leaders referred to activists who practiced techniques of good black self that served as a model for students to emulate. SCLC trained teachers at their Dorchester training center in Mcintosh, Georgia. After completing the training, which took about a week, teachers returned to their communities and set up the schools. The schools help create new SCLC chapters, whose students "definitely knew they were part of SCLC" (quoted in Morris 1984: 238). Second was the emphasis on  incorporating workshops.  "Demonstrations of actual
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
118
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
teaching situations will enable the teacher - trainee to solve real problems. Available are refresher courses which the teacher may attend for advanced training" (SCLC 4-2). Since 'real life' situations provided the substance for the workshops, SCLC considered them more practical and desirable than theoretical discussions on the pros and cons of nonviolence and good manners.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SCLC made a third change in relation to rhythms of southern life. SCLC "Proposed Strategy for Citizenship School Program 1961" (SCLC 4-2) structured the temporal organization around a 12-month calendar. SCLC organized the citizenship training based on the school calendar when college students were attending class and when farmers planted and picked their crops. Recruitment was based July through September. Since recruitment required quantitatively the most labor, the movement could take advantage of college and high school students and teachers, who were on summer break. Supervisors and teaches prepped and trained October through December, when colleges and secondary schools were in session, and the farmers picked cotton. SCLC held the schools and refresher courses in the winter months, January through March, when rural blacks would not have worked the farms. Schools concentrated on political organization April through June to prepare for summer recruitment. Thus, SCLC attempted to organize their activities around a southern cultural rhythm of colleges (future teachers) and the rural agricultural economy.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
We can observe SCLC's shift in emphasis from voter registration to incorporating the training of body/mind in relation to how SCLC presented the citizenship program to the public.   In the 1961 SCLC Report to the director,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
119
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Walker described the citizenship schools as instructing "The whole areas of good
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizenship is explored to equip every person that he might move with confidence
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and assurance in the coming integrated society we seek" (WF 29-12).   The
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SCLC  pamphlet "Citizen  Education  Program" defined  the  purpose  of the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizenship schools as teaching ethical practices of good citizenship.    The
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizenship schools:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
They help students to pass literacy tests for voting. But they also give an all-around education in community development which included housing, recreation, health and improved home life. Specific subjects include filing income tax forms, understanding of tax-supported resources such as water testing for wells, aid to handicap children, public health facilities, how government is run, social security etc. (CC 3-2)
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The idea of instructing to how to care for the home and the family was a rejection
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
that the family operated autonomously from the local southern culture.   SCLC
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
emphasized improving a set of ethical bodily practices including the body and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
physical environment (housing), body and recreation (leisure) body and health,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and body and improved home life (family).  Water testing for wells improved the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
quality of water ingested.   Southern rural areas may have had no water or poor
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
water  quality.        Visually,   poor  water  is   of  yellowish   or  brownish   tint.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Improvements to these immediate body-society relations changed how the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
general southern black populace interpreted their expectations of the self, the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
civil rights movement, and the county/state/federal government.   A 'clean' and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
'healthy' environment produced good black citizens.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In sum, the adoption of the citizenship schools for shaping personal, social
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and civic ethical practices was a process that developed unevenly from the end
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
of the Montgomery movement until 1961.   The rights project was most active
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
120
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
where citizenship schools and workshops existed. 1958-1961 saw little action from the SCLC, which focused on mass voting drives but no citizenship pedagogy. However, student involvement thrived, in part, because of their participation in the nonviolent workshops and Highlander citizenship schools. SNCC organized the sit-ins, and CORE organized the "Freedom Rides". By 1961, SCLC formed citizenship schools after the highlander model to instruct techniques of good black self to a geographically and culturally diverse black populace. Next, I illustrate the relationship techniques of good black self and the body. THE CITIZENSHIP SCHOOLS
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
We cannot judge the citizenship schools success or merit based on how many or how few blacks SCLC registered to vote. For instance, SCLC's "Summary of Citizenship Schools" from October 25 1962 reported 2910 persons were trained in a 5- day workshop and 114 persons trained in a refresher course. There were 263 classes, 2330 number of attendees, and 2464 registered black voters through the classes. Citizenship school trainees registered 13,266 blacks through community drives and voter canvassing (SCLC 4-2). By 1964, SCLC reported 225 active voter registration groups, 560 inactive voter registration groups, 216 SCLC affiliates, 219 active adult citizenship school classes (average 15 students each), 1,060 inactive (temporarily) adult citizenship school classes (trained 12,271 students) (WF 27-18). Whether or not these numbers represent 'progress' because of the complexity of restrictions on black voter registration, or 'failure' because these numbers are small in relation to the number of blacks
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
121
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
living the south is a mute point. The movement programs existed for the purpose of training blacks on how to be good citizens. They represented a broader cultural change and deracializing strategy to break individual identification with racial groups, and attach an identity with idealized American nationhood.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
I used SCLC's "citizenship workbook" and other pedagogy materials to analyze how they instructed they body on personal, social and civic ethical practices. The workbook repeated the same information found in all the pamphlets noting its work on "learning to read and write an all-around education in community development which includes housing, recreation, health and improved home life. Specific subjects are emphasized such as safe driving, social security, cooperatives, the income tax..." (CC 3-2, WF 29-13). The five-day organization represented how the schools taught 'simple' bodily postures first (good handwriting) and 'complex' bodily practices involving mastering emotions last (nonviolence). Once students were introduced to the art of good citizenship, they were given sample tasks like "Planning a Voter Registration Campaign" and worked together on how to plan a block party, or how to fill out a sample page of voter education spread sheet. Civic Vocabulary
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The citizenship schools used bodily training to fix a normative style of interpretation and understanding of good citizenship and racial injustice. Specifically, good citizenship pedagogy shaped the body to master good handwriting, good manners, and nonviolent practices. Good handwriting meant learning how to hold a pen/pencil, writing in a straight line with a consistent
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
122
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
height. Samples in the book recommend practicing on paper with lines to master
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
this art. Good handwriting equated to good citizenship, "It is important to have a
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
handwriting that others can read. A strong, sure handwriting shows that you are
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
a strong person.    All of our first class citizens should  have a first class
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
handwriting" (CC 3-2, WF 29-13).   Good handwriting signified the accumulation
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
of knowledge. Good black citizens exhibited good handwriting to project a strong
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and confident image.   In addition, exhibiting good handwriting skills embodied
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
cultural ideals of cleanliness and goodness.   Bad handwriting embodied bad
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
cultural ideals of sloppy and unkempt.  Good black citizens mastered the art of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
handwriting as a good civic practice.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Practicing good handwriting allowed for broader civic participation.   The
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
workbook stated:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
As you improve your writing, new worlds of pleasure will open and old fears will pass away. You will be able to write to your newspaper and express your views on the events of your community. You can write your congressmen or senator to help him to vote for things that will help our people, and you will not be shy about filling out job application blanks, signing your name to your checks or registering to vote (CC3-2, WF 29-13)
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
On the one hand, good handwriting produced texts that were more than legible.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Legible handwriting was important when engaging with cultural and political
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
authority figures.   On the other hand, mastering good handwriting fashioned a
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
'second reading' or implicit reading for the reader that represented blacks as
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
good citizens.  It distinguished them from the letters written with bad handwriting.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The second reading of a letter in bad penmanship ranged from a letter of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
123
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
complaint, with no rational argument, to a letter from a citizen who lacked self-mastery and did not fully comprehend the argument.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Blacks could practice good handwriting in a number of ways. One way was in relation to pleasures of consumption and public life, "How to Write my name and Address on a Mail order blank. Writing a friendly letter (w/practice lesson) - heading, greeting, body, closing, signature. How to fill out a Money order blank" - practice money order (CC 3-2, WF 29-13)." In order to make the sessions pleasurable, the workbook suggested mastering immediate practices in relation to everyday, like purchasing items through the mail. It gave blacks access to things like a Sears Roebuck catalog that skirted issues of segregated shopping areas. It also allowed for communication between friends and relatives. This was important because much of the rural black south did not have electricity or phones. If they did have phones, they could not afford the longdistance telephone charges. Thus, linking good handwriting with consumption and associational practices provided a pleasurable component that drew in adult students.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Practicing   good   handwriting   by  constructing  words,   sentences  and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
narratives around significations of good civic practices, idealized American civic
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
culture, and the civil rights movement, expanded civic vocabulary.  For instance,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
one task stated:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Make words out of the alphabet, then use them in sentences and stories
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
a attorney - amendments - abridged - alderman
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
c Chatham - congressional - county - circuit - citizen - constitution
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
e exercises - election - elect - executive - electorate
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
r representatives - rebellion - register - resident - regulation
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
w whites - workshop - world - white house (CC 3-2, WF 29-13)
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
124
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Practicing good penmanship allowed for the construction of a good civic vocabulary. An increased civic vocabulary increased the understanding and interpretation of why and how to make claims for rights. Students did not learn vocabulary and sentence structure by learning words like 'mat', 'pat', 'sat', 'cat', like kindergarten reading exercises. Students mastered a civic vocabulary by linking "amendments", "congressional" "election" "register" and "whites" to understand how bad whites denied blacks the right to vote. Mastering an expanded civic vocabulary projected the image of strong and confident black citizens making rights claims with conviction and determination. A good civic vocabulary limited the amount of frustration, confusion, resentment and fear experienced when bad whites attempted to explain to them why they could not register to vote and the legality of their protest techniques.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Once blacks expanded their civic vocabulary, they could construct stories in relation to specific events in the civil rights movement. The workbooks provided the following list of word to organize the movement's collective memory, "Use some of the above words to make a story: state, train, on rain, register, sit in, it, Etta, station, strain, tag, rotten, get, ten, ton, treat, stranger" (CC 3-2, WF 29-13). Blacks practiced good handwriting when constructing narratives to recount and recollect past protest. The citizenship schools supplied the words to guide blacks to interpret the civil rights movement as a struggle for rights and civic inclusion. The narratives could emphasize or deemphasize key characters depending on each local culture. Some narrative could be heroic and emphasis the role of blacks in desegregating "trains" or buses.   Other narratives could
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
125
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
emphasize the role of a repressive state.   Thus, the movement defined the content and style of writing the narrative as a good personal ethical practice.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
A supplemental SCLC pedagogy handout "Helpful Hints in Teaching Citizenship Classes" also suggested paying special attention to the pronunciation of words used in demonstrations: "Pronounce and define the following words. Make sentences from each. Larceny, Commissioner, Register, Congressman, Bonafide, Affidavit, Signature, Elector, Residence, Applicant" (CC 3-2). Fixing a style of pronunciation to black citizenship signified an articulate and well-mannered black citizenry. Ensuring the pronunciation of key words to use when attempting to register deracialized the association intelligence with race. Whites used the improper pronunciation of words as an indication that blacks did not deserve rights. How blacks spoke the words were just as important and knowing what the words meant. Good Manners
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Learning good manners meant mastering social ethical practices in relations to others. Specifically, it meant mastering the role of good listener and good speaker, "When other people are talking, I listen. Harry likes me to listen when he talks. She likes me to listen when she talks. One has good manners if he listens when others talk. When I talk I want other people to hear me" (CC 3-2, WF 29-13). The good listener shaped their body to be attentive. A good listener looked the speaker in the eye when the speaker spoke. A bad listener shook his/her head or looked away while another spoke.   Bad listeners interrupt the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
126
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
others thought.   Good manners required mastering bodily and verbal forms of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
communication.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Mastering good manners also required learning a style of speaking based
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
on what counted as appropriate content for discussion and how not to sound
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
domineering.   When speaking with another, the good citizen does not want to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
appear trite or boring, but also does not want to appear overly confidant like a
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
braggart or 'know it all'. The workbook indicated how good citizens exhibit good
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
manners:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
I talk about things my friends are interested in. I speak so that everyone can understand me. It is not polite to do all the talking. Everyone likes to talk some... My friends like to tell me about their jobs. They like me to discuss their community problems with me. I like to tell them about by [sic] job and my children. She discusses with her friends the ways they can share in the running of their city... When your friend is talking, do not interrupt. It is not polite to interrupt. Everyone likes people who listen when he talks (CC 3-2, WF 29-13).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Good manners meant mastering the proper pronunciation and pace (not too fast,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
no too slow) when talking.  Good citizens are articulate.  The substance of good
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
mannered conversations meant discussing personal matters Gobs, family) that
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
produced the friendship bonds that allows for broader discussion of political
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
matters. A good mannered conversation was a strategy to talk about matters of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
public concern in a respectful and civil way.    It ensured that good citizens
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
mastered their emotions in times of disagreement. Mastering affective response
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
through techniques of good manners meant exhibiting a rational and convincing
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
demeanor when debating with others who were not of like mind.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The art of mastering good manners specifically meant mastering the art of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
being polite. The workbook suggested practicing the follow lesson on politeness:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
127
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Introduce a new friend to your other friends. When you introduce a man to a woman, call the woman's first name. When you introduce a younger person to an older person, call the older person's name first... Tell something about the new friend you are introducing. Tell your old friends something about the new friend. Say the names of the person clearly. Be polite and introduce your friends (CC 3-2, WF 29-13).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Politeness was a way to establish a favorable impression when encountering
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
someone new, and introducing new people to one another for the first time.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Politeness did not just announce ones name but also defined the status of each
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
actor. As we can see from the example, politeness was gendered (man/women)
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and generational (man/boy) in the order of introduction and acknowledgement.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Politeness insured that inter-group relations, specifically black-white interactions,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
would be civil and cordial to limit racial tensions.   Good manners also insured
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
cordial intra-group or black-black relations, which was important for networking,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
organizing and mobilizing southern black communities.    For black attendees,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
practicing good manners meant mastering their emotional responses in times of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
disagreement. By mastering their affective responses, blacks exhibited a rational
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and convincing demeanor when debating with others who were not of like mind.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Nonviolence and Civic Ethical Practices
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Nonviolence was a civic ethical practice all movement activists had to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
master.    SCLC forbade all forms of violence within the social space of the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizenship schools.    One explicit rule was "Shooting firearms and exploding
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
fireworks are  not permitted  on the  centers grounds" (CC  3-2, WF 29-13).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Restrictions like these were to encourage blacks to live without guns. A common
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
practice for southern rural blacks was to carry guns for protection against
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
lynching. In contrast to role-playing, where blacks participated in practice runs to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
128
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
test ones ability to master their emotions (see below), the citizenship schools focused on the whys of nonviolence. For instance, in a section titled the "Power of Nonviolence", the text indicated, "When we don't fight back, they are forced to think about why we don't. This is the beginning of understanding, understanding is the stepping stone to true brotherhood" (CC 3-2, WF 29-13). Practicing nonviolence was a deracializing strategy that forced bad whites to confront their own actions and behaviors. The workbook suggested practicing nonviolent tasks by learning and recounting how Gandhi and the Montgomery Movement used nonviolence through a series of discussion questions. Discussion questions were,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
1.  What would happen in your town if minority groups used violent racist means to solve their problems?
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
2.   What  happens when   nothing   is  done  to  overcome  community problems?
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
3.  How can non-violence be used in your community? (CC 3-2, WF 29-13)
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Discussion groups provided the space to identity both the benefits of nonviolence
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
as well as the consequences of violence. The idea was to bracket out alternative
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
strategies that suggested violence as the preferred technique of resistance.   If
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
blacks used violence, whites would retaliate with violence and likely produce
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
genocide. Violence does not solve underlying racial problems in the community.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In sum, the citizenship schools illustrated how the movement shaped the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
body to exhibit good civic practices by practicing good handwriting to develop a
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
civic vocabulary and mastering the art of good manners.   Good black citizens
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
acquired the knowledge of what counted as good citizenship at the same time
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
they mastered bodily postures.  However, the citizenship schools were only one
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
129
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
aspect of shaping good bodily practices. Before blacks could participate in public protest, they were required to go through further training that simulated situations that tested blacks mastering of their bodies and emotions. MOVEMENT WORKSHOPS: THE BODY AND ROLE-PLAYING
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
An important pedagogical technique that cut across the rights and grassroots projects' programs was the workshop. Activists completed workshops before desegregating buses, staging sit-ins, and marching in Albany, Birmingham and Selma15. Workshops differed from citizenship school participatory discussion because they deemphasized discussion in favor of "role-playing". Role-playing was the simulation of social situations involving blacks and bad whites to provide opportunities for blacks to practice mastery of bodily conduct and affective response. The rights and grassroots project used discourses of good black citizenship to organize role-playing instructed and regulated the style, conduct and responses in relation to bad citizenship. Repetitive simulation fixed civic ethical practices to and stabilized an idea of the good black citizen. While scholars have been aware of the workshops, very little historical evidence exists as to their exact form. To illustrate how the workshops functioned, I use a book titled Manual for Direct Action written by civil rights activists Martin Oppenheimer and George Lakey, and forward by Bayard Rustin. Published in 1965, it was a compilation and history of how to engage in direct action, including how to set up the role-playing techniques, how to manage the press, and how ensure bodily
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
15 King noted that when asking for volunteers during the Birmingham movement, "Mindful of the difficulties involved, we decided to undertake a process of self-purification. We began a series of workshops on nonviolence, and we repeatedly asked ourselves: 'Are you able to accept blows without retaliating?' 'Are you able to endure the ordeal of jail?'"(King 1964: 80).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
130
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
safety when being arrested. The subject of the manual is the history civil rights movement. The authors focused on what the movement did before, and how they did it, in order to encourage more volunteers to join the movement. I describe the manual as a compilation because the authors were compiling data from their experiences with Mississippi Freedom Summer, that reprints, or represents, the nonviolent teachings and workshops of Lawson and SCLC, and other manuals the movement referenced when developing these pedagogical technique.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Role-playing prepared the body for public protest. Sample Scenarios for role-playing included: how good citizens dealt with landlords if they were evicted, how they approach their congressmen, what to do if a barbershop refused to cut black hair, how to practice good manners in court, how to protect the body during a sit-in, how to hold cordial committee meetings, how to ensure an orderly picket line, and how to avoid having a march transform into a riot (Oppenheimer and Lakey 1965: 67-72). Role-playing allowed activists "to practice skills. Participants, by taking on various roles, learn how to behave in different situations. They get an idea of what to expect and how to react in the best way... Mistakes are less likely later on" (Oppenheimer and Lakey 1965: 64). It was important to master affective response in different contexts because the body can adapt to repetitive training. Although techniques can condition the body to master emotional outbursts and exhibit good postures in a march to a courthouse, it does not mean activists can apply this to a situation of overt police violence. Some activists may exhibit self-restraint to shouts of 'nigger' but not to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
131
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
police batons, or vice versa. It was important to make mistakes and identify ones limits in the simulations before engaging real demonstrations. Role-playing allowed civil rights volunteers to identify their weaknesses ahead of time.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Civil rights volunteers used role-playing simulations to overcome their 'weaknesses' and 'limitations'. One technique built into role-playing to practice affective mastery was taking on the role of other, "to understand your opponent. By playing opponents' roles, the worker gets to feel how the opponent thinks and feels. This will be of tremendous value in the real situation, because the worker will be better able to make judgments as to possible reactions to various tactics" (Oppenheimer and Lakey 1965: 64). Training the body in both the protagonist and antagonist roles linked the embodied good black self with the bad white other. For blacks, playing the role of 'activists' fixed good civic tactical and strategic judgments through exhibiting self-mastery in relation to typical bad white response. Playing the role of the bad white allowed civil rights volunteers to embody the perceptions and judgments of bad whites. It provided a better understanding of why bad whites perceive their actions to be just. One could begin preparing or bracing the self in advance knowing what was coming. Knowing how the other perceives and responds to a situation reinforces why it is necessary to counter with good civic practices, thereby restricting the number of possible responses the body can perceive as a desirable response.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Role-playing taught volunteers how to manage their emotions. The problem of emotions was the immediate management (e.g. during the protest) as
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
132
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
well as the emotional stability over time. Role-playing provided and outlet for the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
right way to:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Get rid of tensions. It is important, when in action, to keep tensions under control... People 'crack' under strain and 'blow up.' After a while, some begin to suffer the equivalent of 'battle fatigue.' Obviously this presents a real danger if it takes place in an actual situation. In the workshop the opportunity is created to get rid of tensions before the action (Oppenheimer and Lakey 1965: 54).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Role-playing sought to guard against long-term emotional and bodily fatigue.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The tired body, or the physically beaten body, was susceptible to mistakes and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
jeopardizing affective self-mastery.   Emotional fatigue, or being 'burnt out', also
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
increased the possibility of mistakes, loss of interest, and wavering commitment
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
to the movement. Therefore, role-playing was advantageous for both the novice
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and seasoned veteran civil rights workers.  For the novice, it was a technique to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
keep tensions resulting from anger, outrage and resentment from slipping to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
bodily practices. For the civil rights veteran, it was a way to express tensions, by
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
either playing the role of the bad whites, expelling the emotional outbursts in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
scripted yelling and/or hitting, or by reinforcing the commitment to good black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizenship through the repetition of affective control practices.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Role-playing required actors performing the roles of bad whites and good
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
blacks, as well as an audience to judge and interpret the simulation.    The
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
audiences' role was to judge and confirm if activists were ready to participate in a
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
demonstration, as indicated by the participants' mastery over their affective
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
responses. However, members of the audience also had to exhibit self-discipline
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
when making observations.  Effective role-playing "requires an audience as well
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
as participants, but the audience must be cautioned not to laugh or react.  They
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
133
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
are the observers and will be asked to evaluate and comment after the 'scenario' is concluded" (Oppenheimer and Lakey 1965: 65). Audience members were responsible for managing their conduct when observing so as make the simulation seem 'more real'. Audiences must control affective responses such as laughter, crying or outrage. They also must refrain from exhibiting demeanors that made them appear condescending or demeaning. That is, audiences must appear objective to confirm the seriousness of the simulation, as well as the objectivity of the interpretation of whether or not the activist is ready for real public demonstrations. Thus, role-playing provided an opportunity to practice self-mastery over affective response in three roles - the volunteer, the bad white, and the audience. Each role embodied a different perspective of the situation, yet required affective and bodily self-mastery for a successful performance. Good Bodily Practices in Public Demonstrations and the Media
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Mastering affective response and exhibiting good bodily conduct was necessary for executing a proper demonstration. The manual suggested marching, parading, picketing, and vigils as basic techniques of civil disobedience. Volunteers were advised to exhibit deracialized techniques of self while demonstrating for rights. In order to prevent opponents from discrediting the march as "disorderly and violent", volunteers should "have silence, or singing in unison" (Oppenheimer and Lakey 1965: 74). This disciplining technique made the group act as one, thereby reducing the chances of any one individual acting out.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
134
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
A variation of the march is the picket line. Unlike a march, picket lines are more localized, usually with a specific grievance in mind. The manual suggests that individuals participating in the picket line appear neat and orderly at all times. An orderly picket line meant assembling the volunteers "someplace other than the place where the picket line will be, then go to the place in a group" (Oppenheimer and Lakey 1965: 75). This prevented activists from loitering. Loitering signified lack of purpose and focus. Once assembled, it was important to "avoid unnecessary scurrying about" (Oppenheimer and Lakey 1965: 75). Bodies should remain in the designated geographical space to project an image of purposeful political action. It also meant exhibiting the proper postures when picketing. "Expect participants to walk erectly and not slouch, call out, laugh loudly, or use profanity; smoking may be ruled out in some situations" (Oppenheimer and Lakey 1965: 75). Picketers should exhibit good bodily postures that associated the demonstration with good citizenship. They should limit bad civic bodily practices of slouching, improper language and volume of speaking, that indicates bad citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Conducting a vigil provided its own set of challenges. Since they required standing still for a long duration, vigils could be enduring on the body. However, the manual noted that vigils resonated with American ideals of Christianity. "In a culture like ours where religion is held in high esteem, a vigil is sometimes more effective than picketing; however, it is slightly more wearying and requires more self- and group-discipline" (Oppenheimer and Lakey 1965: 74). Vigils, therefore, were effective when used at the proper time, with the proper people, and in the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
135
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
right space.    Experienced civil rights workers who previously illustrated the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
capability of self-mastery and endurance were best suited to partake in vigils.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Since the vigil attempts symbolic resonance with idealized American virtues of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Christianity, its use should be restricted to areas that emphasized Christian
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
ethics.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Exhibiting good black civic practice meant mastering a style of conduct in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
relation with the media.    Before giving a press conference, the movement
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
advised to:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Make your charges believable... Watch your language. Use English that makes sense to the community in which you are working. Watch your appearance. Appearance is a communicating device. You cannot expect people to raise their own standards of cleanliness, or look up to you as a leader, if you act like a slob. The civil rights worker gives up some of his private rights when he joins the movement (Oppenheimer and Lakey 1965: 52-53).
&lt;/p&gt;

Mastering deracialized techniques of self helped blacks while making media
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
appearances. Activists appearing on television or radio should speak clearly, in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
'proper' English, and be clean and well dressed.   Although some activists may
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
resist the regulation of self-presentation, the manual notes that civil rights
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
workers forfeit some of their rights of free choice when joining the movement.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The movement expected all civil rights volunteers to conform to good bodily
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
practices.    Volunteers who did not, or could not master good black civic
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
practices, were not allowed to participate in civil rights activities and protest.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Bodies and Police Beatings
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Placing the body in public opened it up to physical punishment.   Blacks
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
had to train their bodies how to master their affective response in relation to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
136
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
police brutality. Since the police embodied the state's legitimate use of violence, civil rights protesters had to be ready for the police use 'weapons'. Police used tear gas as a favored police technique for dispersing crowds. The manual offers a series of suggestions of how to protect the body to limit the chance of an emotional outburst. If the group is tear-gassed, "Retreat in an orderly fashion from the scene... Clothing permeated with fumes should be changed. Persons affected by gas attack should face into the wind (assuming there is no further gas) and/or wash eyes and face in water (stick your head in a bucketful, if possible)" (Oppenheimer and Lakey 1965: 91). Tear gas affected the visual capacity of the body. It burns the eyes, causing some disorientation as to what is going on. Since the body's first response when getting something in its eye is to attempt to rub it out, volunteers should practice not touching their eyes. Rubbing the eyes after being tear-gassed will make it worse. Knowing the correct way to respond to tear gas prevented panic and other affective outburst. Good black citizens' exhibited good civic practices at all times during a protest.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Besides tear gas, civil rights activists also faced physical violence. In contrast to the police shooting tear gas into a crowd, police violence such as direct blows from police nightsticks, bats or fist, happens in close spatial proximity. There is also the greater likelihood that activists will interpret intimate police violence personally, therefore, placing more responsibility on the volunteer to master affective response. The manual relays a lesson from James Lawson. Lawson said that when meeting physical attack, "There are two nonviolent reactions to a physical attack.   One is to stand up to it and try to make eye
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
137
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
contact with the attackers; the other is to fall down and cover up" (Oppenheimer
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and Lakey 1965: 93).   Lawson suggested that civil rights activists should follow
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the second technique of covering up and protecting the body when attacked.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Covering up:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
It is intended to protect the most vital parts of the body, through adopting a crouching position with hands over the head and ears, while lying on the ground. If a buddy is undergoing severe attack, and is on the ground, it is often wise to place yourself between the attackers and the victim by means of falling over the victim, face down, approximating the position of a person doing a 'push-up' on the 'up' part, but keeping your face down and tucked into your chest (Oppenheimer and Lakey 1965: 93)
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Covering up was a technique of absorbing physical blows to limit the amount of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
physical punishment.   Knowing how to take and absorb physical punishment
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
limits the damage and  blunts the  pain.     Learning  how to take  physical
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
punishment, to lesson the pain, makes it easier to master self-restraint.  Rather
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
than attack the police to make them stop, the manual suggested individuals
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
situate their body in between that of the victim and the attacker.   Absorbing
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
physical punishment for a friend, sacrificing ones body, is a self-less act. The act
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
of sacrificing ones body for ideals of nonviolence strengthens bonds between
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
activists, distinguishing activists as heroic.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Limiting the amount of physical  punishment the body absorbs also
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
required preparing for the best way to prepare for arrest and going to jail.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Specifically, it meant clothing the body in a way that provided padding and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
protection from police physical assault:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Wear loose clothing in order not to be choked when dragged. Wear decent, tough clothing, but not your best. If you expect to be jailed, wear two sets of underclothes so that you can wear one set while washing the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
138
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
other. This is also helpful padding if you are dragged about the police. An extra pair of socks also helps. Wear a sweater or trench coat - cells get cold, and the coat will help cover your leg or serve as a pillow. Take a bunch of kleenex or toilet paper in case that commodity is not available right away (Oppenheimer and Lakey 1965: 109).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Since the civil rights movement used mass arrest to fill the jails, and southern
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
police were eager to arrest, civil rights activists expected to go to jail.   The
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
manual recommended layering clothes for protection, but not to the extent, that it
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
will affect an individual's personal appearance. Activists should not sacrifice how
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
they presented the body for the sake of physical protection.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Once in prison, the civil rights movement expected protesters to exhibit
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
good social ethical practices in relation to prison guards and other prisoners.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The manual reprinted suggested rules for prison from an SCLC pamphlet
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
"Handbook for Freedom Army Recruits" that instructed civil rights activists on
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
how to be a good prisoner. They included:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Always act and speak with honesty. Cooperate with prison officials and don't break prison rules unless are against dignity and self-respect or our principles. Do all jobs to the best of your ability. Have regard for fellow prisoners and do not be selfish. Do nothing to demoralize your fellow prisoners. Take responsibility for keeping everyone in good spirits. Do not take part in teasing or conversation that might hurt feelings or start a fight (Oppenheimer and Lakey 1965: 113).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Practicing techniques of good black self did not end when locked behind bars.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Good black citizens mastered their bodily postures and affective states in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
differing, hostile and unpleasant situations. Being a good prisoner represented
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
unjust imprisonment.    Therefore, imprisoned civil rights workers were not to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
exhibit any behaviors that artificially distinguished them from other prisoners.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Exhibiting good prisoner behavior was also a matter of personal safety behind
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
139
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
bars.  Bad behavior could initiate violence between civil rights workers and other
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
prisoners, or lead to increased police repression towards jailed civil rights
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
workers and/or other inmates.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SNCC's GRASSROOTS POLITICAL PROJECT AND LEADERSHIP TRAINING
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SNCC used discourses of good black citizenship to develop training
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
guidelines to shape a black political agent capable of autonomous leadership.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The idea behind SNCC's grassroots project was to organize black communities
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
into independent cells capable of political autonomy.   In their pamphlets, SNCC
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
described   how  they   drew  from   a   grassroots   project  to   organize   black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
communities,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
"SNCC's grassroots approach is designed to .... Build indigenous, trained leadership... on college and high school campuses, and in local communities... SNCC workers have organized and guided local protest movements which are never identified as SNCC projects. This is part of its program of developing, building and strengthening indigenous leadership"16
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Ideally,  each  cell directed their political  activities at the  local  geopolitical
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
community, but could be called on to support and assist national demonstrations,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
like sit-ins or marches.  Political authority was spread horizontally between cells,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
rather than in a vertically or bureaucratically. SNCC's grassroots project differed
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
somewhat than SCLC's deracializing project because of 1) SNCC emphasis on
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
building political communities from the 'ground up', and 2) the different black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
population   SNCC   worked   with,    rural   blacks   versus   urban   blacks,   that
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
accompanied a different set of questions and concerns.   In contrast to SCLC's
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
hierarchal organizing  approached,  modeled after the black church,  SNCC
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
140
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
purposely did not place field organizers in positions of authority. SNCC leaders assisted rural blacks on how to organize, rather than leading the organization. Because of the difference in organizing strategies, SNCC's ability to mobilize southern blacks was based on how well they worked with existing black groups. Indeed, SNCC could not have organized mass protests in Albany, Georgia or throughout Mississippi without the help of local NAACP chapters. Because of the differences in working with urban versus rural black populations, SNCC focused more on organizing political meetings and voter registration than establishing formal citizenship schools. Rather than encourage rural blacks to enter citizenship schools, SNCC allowed them to decide if they were interested in citizenship schools. Rural blacks had a different set of concerns - like physical safety from Klan violence, and fair trade on crops - than urban blacks who were more likely to have worked industrial jobs and dealt with white citizens' councils.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Despite the differences in political projects, SNCC and SCLC used discourses of good black citizenship to instruct deracialized techniques of self. What was different was that SNCC asked a different set of questions, like the best way to enter an unfamiliar black community, and the best way to run a political meeting. Because organizing rural black communities meant a decrease in surveillance techniques to reinforce nonviolent practices, the responsibility to practice nonviolence was placed on individual field workers. Therefore, questions of how to master various levels of ascetic bodily practices in relation to nonviolence also circulated amongst SNCC workers. Thus, SNCC's training programs had the dual emphasis of shaping ethical civic practices as well as
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
141
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
reproducing their membership ranks.   Nevertheless, they fashioned a style of conduct begetting of good citizens to enter a local community, as well as how to interact with the locals once in the community. How to Enter an Unfamiliar Black Community
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The SNCC training booklet, prepared by Charles Sherrod, simply entitled "Non-Violence" (EB 6-14) first outlined how field workers should enter an unfamiliar local black community. Specifically, it focused on how to identify and interpret the population - who to approach and how to do it. The proper way, meaning safest and most effective, to enter a community required the collection of 'macro-information' that provided 'objective' knowledge of the population. That is, knowledge of a local community that indicated how easy or difficult it would be for SNCC to enter. When entering a new community, volunteers should first identify, if any, local civil rights organizations that "have similar purposes" as well as which ones are "antagonistic". In contrast to SCLC, SNCC had to work with groups who shared similar goals of voter registration. Once SNCC workers identified other civil rights groups to work with, the training guide recommended identifying any changes in the community. To identify the changes in the community, the manual suggested activists focus their interpretation on the bodies of local residents to know certain patterns in the community. Specifically, "Shifts in population in facts about people moving in and out of the community -their skills, ages, sex, etc.", the "Work habits of self employed people" and "Changes in thinking and loyalties of people toward various images" (EB 6-14). Demographic patterns indicated the number of young blacks and students, whom
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
142
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SNCC appealed to more than the NAACP. Work habits, changes in thinking would indicate how active the local community was in the struggle for civil rights.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The best way to identify patterns in the local community was to interview local blacks who may be aware of the everyday rhythms of the black community. In addition to mapping objective knowledge onto the population, activist should focus on 'gossip' or subjective knowledge of the black community. This included interviewing grocers on the "spending on food, clothing and general household supplies; gossip", local repairmen on any "changes in spending for farm equipment", barbers and beauticians on important "local issues" and more "gossip" (EB 6-14). What the locals talked about indicated what the community valued, feared, respected and hated. Information on who is spending money on clothes may indicate blacks with leisure time and extra money.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
It was also important to interview local blacks whose employment positions placed them in relations with whites. These included porters in railroads and bus stations. Interviewing blacks who worked in close proximity to whites was a strategy to identify "what white folks say, maids, cab drivers, known Toms. These persons, so close to whites in some ways, may be approached indirectly" (EB 6-14). Since whites were not likely to cooperate with SNCC volunteers, the best way to identify white sentiment towards civil rights was to interview blacks who shared social space with whites at work, and overheard whites' discussions. SNCC workers had to be careful on how they approached these blacks because they may be weary of jeopardizing their economic livelihood by cooperating with civil rights workers.   It was important to distance
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
143
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
themselves from blacks, like 'known Toms', who may betray and interfere with
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
civil rights work.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
How to Set Up Operations Once Inside an Unfamiliar Black Community
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The training manual instructed SNCC leaders what to do once they have gained gain access to the unfamiliar black community. This included how to hold a meeting, how to interact with locals, and how to interact with black professionals in the local communities and the families that housed them. First, it was important to know how to hold a meeting. Besides the importance of holding meetings at regular times and at the same places, "and being in a centralized location", activists must learn how to manage the emotional feelings of the crowd. For instance, Sherrod wrote, "Plan development of emotional peak in meeting or some kind of development - may be intentional development but you many intend to be unintentional" (EB 6-14). Emotional peaks in meetings disciplined the body and shaped embodied judgments, specifically the audiences' evaluation of the problem and how to solve it by 1) using examples of courage to excite and motivate the audience and 2) use words that signified feelings of outrage, anger to motivate blacks to join the movement. One suggested way of creating an emotional peak in the audience was emphasizing how students situated their bodies in relation to bad whites, "Our best selling point is that we are students with nothing but our bodies and minds, fearlessly standing before the monster who killed our mothers and castrated our fathers - yet we stand with love" (EB 6-14). Armed with nothing but their own bodies and minds, SNCC activists created an emotional image of heroic citizens sacrificing for the good of the community.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
144
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Emotionally charge language, like the verb 'castrated' has the polysemic meaning in psychoanalysis of being forcibly separated, but also being denied manhood. Thus, the use of emotions in meetings was a technique to shape the black audiences' evaluations and interpretations of black-white relations and the best way to solve it. SNCC's use of emotions to 'arouse' the audience's interest differed from SCLC's approach that urged blacks to manage affective responses, so as not to exhibit black stereotypes of emotionalism.17
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Second, when interacting with the locals it was important to create social bonds. To create bonds between SNCC workers and strangers in the community, they taught freedom songs, and emphasized developing "personal relationships with students and adults" (EB 6-14). The best way to go about developing personal relationships is to "observe the basic sexual attraction between sexes and utilize this" (EB 6-14). SNCC believed they could use attractive women to get men to join, or vice versa, to recruit blacks who may not be overtly political at first, but may support SNCC for other reasons. SNCC also drew from gendered assumptions that women were less threatening than males, noting, "Women make the best images (impressions)" (EB 6-14). Gendered assumptions of women as 'weak' and 'inferior' did not help perceptions of women as rational black political agents, but it did make them useful for recruiting more black males to the cause. As I noted in the last chapter, the civil rights movement approached civil rights as the responsibility of the black man to gain, in part, a sense of masculinity as he gained a new rights. Thus, the female body
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
17 On occasions when King gave a speech, SCLC did use warm up acts. However, they used speakers, like SCLC vice president Ralph Abernathy, to loosen up the audience with humor rather than getting the crowd riled up, outraged and angry
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
145
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
should be styled and portrayed as feminine in order to make the struggle for civil rights appealing for black men, and non-threatening to whites.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Third, since the vast majority of SNCC volunteers were college students working down south during summer breaks, coupled with the limited monetary resources for housing costs, local families adopted volunteers as part of their family. SNCC referred to the homes of local black families who housed them as 'freedom houses'. Aware of the intimate shared space between volunteers and families, SNCC regulated how each family was to be address and what constituted proper subject matters for public discussion: "We promote the adoption of each of us as their children - we call them moms, pop - that's home). We relate to our professional peers be preaching for ministers; playing chess, discussing medicine, politics, insurance, education, business, etc." (EB 6-14). SNCC regulated how volunteers would interact with adults, and families, in order to show respect for their elders. SNCC limited conversation subject matter to serious matters of public importance. They did not engage in juvenile small talk - sports, members of the opposite sex, gossip etc. Limiting conversations to matters of public importance disassociated SNCC students from both black stereotypes and childish associations. Sherrod wrote that in the act of communication with local black residents, "We build images of respect, courage, suffering, Tomism etc, using various personalities as points of reference" (EB 6-14). In the process of creating new images of good black citizens, Sherrod noted, "We also destroy images". The responsibility was placed on SNCC field workers to convince rural blacks that change was possible.    They had to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
146
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
overcome assumptions that students were not capable for an adult job, a 'man's job', of fighting for civil rights. The regulation of good black practice represented SNCC workers as rational and knowledgeable black political agents capable of initiating social change. Nonviolence and Ascetic Techniques of Self
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to questions of how best to train new leaders, nonviolent periodicals circulated throughout the students, indeed, through all of the civil rights movement. One such periodical, Theory and Practice of Civil Disobedience, was written and published by New Hampshire pacifist Arthur Harvey (RF 1-1). Harvey first published this periodical in July 1961 with a print run of 105 copies. By December 1961, it was in its seventh printing totaling 5070 copies. While the periodical discussed a general theory of nonviolence, it also outlined a set of ascetic practices of self in relation to civil disobedience and Christian virtue. This periodical represents a link between the peace movement and ideas of meditating and the use of sport as an alternative to violence18. It represented texts that circulated amongst liberal protestant pacifist culture the movement drew from. The relationship between nonviolence and religion was the association of virtue with an ascetic mastery of pleasure and temptation.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Harvey defined nonviolence as form of religious asceticism. Mastering nonviolence equated to mastering a set of pleasures that temp the body. Harvey described a list of temptations to master, including "Pleasure-seeking, luxury, ease, wealth and power should be avoided; self-restraint, simplicity, physical
&lt;/p&gt;

147
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
labor and identification with the lowest classes through service - all these strengthen nonviolence". Practicing nonviolence required monastic devotion. Mastering nonviolence and self-restraint equated to virtuous practices of giving up perceived luxuries of the 'modern world', and working with ones hands. We see how Harvey associated self-restraint from bodily pleasures with how he hierarchically orders different forms of nonviolence. A section pondering the question "Should injustice be resisted" implicitly ranks four forms of nonviolence: non-involvement, non-resistance, non-cooperation, and fasting. Non-involvement is considered and extreme practice. It was reserved for the select few individuals to such a level that they do not "attempt to influence others" through political practice. Harvey notes non-involvement, "in social terms this attitude has effect. The practice of celibacy and vegetarianism, for example, strongly suggests that sex and meat-eating are inferior types of behavior - at least to many observers who look for values in the attitudes and conduct of others". The idealized nonviolent subject mastered all temptations that indicate inferior behavior - including the eliminating dietary practices of consuming animals and sexual practices. Mastery over these 'worldly' temptations distinguishes and transforms the pacifist into a symbol to emulate.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Since only a select few might master non-involvement, Harvey evaluated other techniques of civil disobedience. Nonresistance was "too elusive or misunderstood for brief treatment" but it was the nonviolent practice of choice for both Tolstoy and Jesus. Fasting, the art of denying the body food as a means of protest, was taken as a "borderline technique" only useful in specific situations,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
148
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
like prison reform. Physical intervention was dangerous because it involved thwarting the will of the opponent" and may arouse one emotionally. Therefore, Harvey presented non-cooperation as the nonviolent practice for present political struggles like the anti-war/peace and civil rights movements. Non-cooperation, in part, meant mastering the physical body in the "refusal to use one's muscles to comply with commands", including "going limp when taken into custody". Suggested nonviolent techniques aligned with non-cooperation concentrated on using the body as a political weapon, situated at the point of violence. For instance, activists should use the body to obstruct war machines, "the disobedient places his body in a position where he would be killed if the machine continued to function". Thus, non-cooperation used the body to disrupt the rhythms of public space as a symbolic act.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
An overarching theme of this periodical is going to jail. Harvey notes how James Lawson identified a mistake in the student sit-ins as not staying in jail and demanding that adults increase their support and involvement in the struggle for civil rights. For Harvey, commitment to nonviolence and civil disobedience meant that over ones lifetime, one could expect to divide his/her life between, "25% of imprisonment, 25% for picketing, leafleting, speaking, writing, etc., 50% for constructive program - developing an economy to eliminate injustice. In my view this must be agrarian, vegetarian, poor, decentralized and not dependent on technology." How one went to jail mattered. Nonviolent civil disobedience required a commitment for going to jail with a purposive meaning. When entering a plea, "a plea of guilty should be entered".  Harvey does not go into the kind of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
149
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
detail of the best ways to prepare for arrest and jail that the Manual for Direct Action does. However, he does note that 'going limp' was up to each individual, but just going along with the arrest was ok too. There was also a set of rules to observe when going to jail. When interacting with other prisoners, Harvey recommends, "Don't be talkative or discuss personal matters with prisoners you don't know pretty well. Many homosexuals are looking for partners". In contrast to SCLC ideal of the good prisoner, Harvey intertwines personal safety in jail with not giving into temptation and being penetrated, or feminized. In some respects, Harvey is attempting to compensate for the lack of masculine virtues (tough, rugged etc) associated with nonviolence with religious based homophobia. That is, nonviolent men were still good citizens and masculine because they did not signify "gay" - feminine, weak, and lacking self-restraint from temptation.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Thus, SNCC's grassroots political project used discourses of good black citizenship to organize ethical practices to organize autonomous political cells. The important ethical practices were what counted as proper subject matter of public discussions, how to use emotions at political rallies, and mastering nonviolence. The Harvey periodical illustrated how the care of the body, in relation to dietary and sexual austerity, intertwined with a virtuous nonviolent practice. Since the grassroots project placed the responsibility on individual field workers to remain nonviolent, ascetic practices of anti-consumerism and vegetarian disciplined the body to master emotional responses. While civil rights movement activists were definitely not refraining from having sex, many of the leaders, including King, did associate nonviolence with a religious asceticism of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
150
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
refraining from consumer goods and representing the plight of the poor. These debates over the proper care of the body filtered into SNCC programs that instructed on practices of public health and what constitutes a proper diet. Next, I illustrate how SNCC articulated debates over the body - good listening and speaking, and the healthy body - and inscribed them into bodily practices in Mississippi Freedom Summer 1964.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
THE FREEDOM SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY CENTERS OF THE 1964 MISSISSIPPI FREEDOM SUMMER
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Freedom summer was a response to the expansion and influence of SNCC's grassroots project. Similar to SCLC's citizenship schools, the idea behind freedom summer was to setup alternative schools to train blacks on ethical practices in order to get them to a point where they could organize and sustain autonomous black political communities. Freedom summer differed from other SNCC projects because 1) they sought to mobilize Mississippi blacks into an independent political party to challenge local and state authority rather than federal authority, 2) it emphasized community health standards instead of voter registration, and 3) it was centralized in northern Mississippi as opposed to decentralized independent cells scattered throughout the south. These three differences represented a shift from organizing blacks as 'individuals', associated with the idea of liberalism, to organizing southerners as a group, black and white, in relation to shared geopolitical territory. SNCC saw limitations of organizing rural blacks in relation to idealized American citizenship, which placed the responsibility individual blacks to master deracialized techniques of self, because
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
151
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
of the 'lack of progress' in the movement (SNCC wanted more improvements at the local level) in relation to the changing political culture (post-1963 civil rights act). This shift to organizing blacks as a collective group made it possible for SNCC post-1965 Voting Rights act to draw from discourses of black authenticity and suggest that blacks were better off organizing as separate racial group (see chapter 4). However, in 1964 they still used discourses of good black citizenship to organize Mississippi blacks and whites into an interracial challenge Mississippi's Democratic Party.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The "freedom schools" and "community centers" were the Mississippi Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) signature program. COFO was a conglomerate of all nation civil rights groups, local civil rights groups and fraternal organizations operating in Mississippi. Although COFO was a conglomerate of all civil rights groups, SNCC was the dominant member. COFO came about after SNCC workers began voter registration drives in 1961. White anti-civil rights sentiment forced SNCC to focus its political activities in the Northern Mississippi Delta region and Greenwood in 196219. SNCC moved its operations to the Mississippi Delta because they believed that the "vague antipathy of the hill folk for the rich planters" provided better opportunities for inter-racial political organizing, since blacks and poor whites 'shared' impoverished social and geographical space. That is, SNCC believed that blacks and whites could organize around the idea of sharing a common geopolitical territory and economic positioning. In Greenwood, SNCC began to network with local groups,

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the "Holmes County Voters League" and the "Ruleville Citizenship Group", as well as SCLC citizenship schools, which provided the pedagogical structure of the freedom schools20. SCLC provided the structure for organizing the schools and helped train teachers at their Dorchester site.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The summer of 1964, known in Mississippi as "Freedom Summer", COFO established a series of freedom schools and community centers that trained Mississippi blacks on the ethical practices associated with good citizenship, which resulted in the formation of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. By July 1964, there were 41 functioning schools dispersed throughout 20 Mississippi counties, totaling 2135 students.21 COFO divided freedom summer programs into three working parts - voting registration, freedom schools, and community centers. Neither program was autonomous from the other. All shared the end goal mastering a set of ethical practices that prepared blacks for roles within the civil right movement. Similar to SCLC's citizenship schools, freedom schools organized the spatial and temporal rhythm around the everyday lives of the local geopolitical community of rural black Mississippian. Freedom schools differentiated local geopolitical cultures between three contexts "rural, urban with strong civil rights movement, urban with weak civil rights movement"22 Literacy, trust, and desire to participate varied depending on the context of preexisting political work, and urban/rural cultural differences.

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
COFO organized some freedom schools in basements and outdoor areas of local black churches, while they organized others in black storefronts and homes23. Because of the nontraditional learning space, COFO suggested teachers, "Spend your time making your schoolroom full of the physical conditions for learning - reference books and materials in inviting and handy places"24. Teachers decorated space to appear more 'scholastic' to cultivate a learning environment. When possible, teachers brought in chalkboards, bookshelves, or alphabet posters to associate the makeshift spaces with "school". Some schools were run on the back lawns of churches, were a space under a tree served as a classroom. Regardless of where the schools were set up, COFO emphasized consistency and regularity in time and space25. Curriculum varied by time of day. Morning classes were organized around the topics like "Negro history and citizenship" while late morning classes focused on cultural development of typing, learning French, drama or working on the school newspaper.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Freedom schools also implemented the same learning strategies as SCLC's citizenship schools. They included discussion groups rather than lecturing because of need to train "children of the non-verbal 'culturally deprived' community the ability to formulate questions and articulate perception"26. COFO also emphasized selecting the right teachers. They used psychiatrists to screen

and weed out volunteers considered "dangerous to the movement" (quoted in Carson 1994: 111). COFO defined dangerous individuals as too idealistic, anti-political, and had their own ideas of what to do that contrasted with the freedom school program. Individuals accepted to teach were required to familiarize themselves with a shared foundation of knowledge, organized around mastering certain texts that the movement as a whole was reading or have read. COFO sent a letter to all accepted teachers asking that "all summer participants to read several books so we can assume some knowledge in common" (RS 1-1). The standard set of text ensured a base of knowledge associated with a discourse of good black citizenship. The required book list, ranked in order of importance, was Cash's The Mind of the South, Dubois's Souls of Black Folk, Harrington's The Other America, and King's Stride Toward Freedom, and Smith's Killers of the Dream (RS 1-1). These texts ensured not only the familiarity of southern culture and the history of the movement, but they also told a specific history of how blacks have successfully struggled for equality. Since the goal was to train students in the art of civic ethical practice, freedom schools tailored their citizenship pedagogy around Mississippi's local geopolitical concerns. Students were "given practice activities to improve their skills with reading and writing. Writing press releases, leaflets etc. for the political campaigns is one example. Writing affidavits and reports for arrests, demonstrations, trials etc. which occur during the summer of their town will be another".27 Other skills included "using the telephone as a campaign tool" and learning about the "forces" against Fannie Lou Farmer in particular, and blacks in general, from "even attempting to run for 27 "Prospectus for the Mississippi Freedom Summer" located in CC 1-1

              &lt;p&gt;
Congress in Mississippi". Thus, freedom schools took SCLC's pedagogical strategies and modified them according to the specific problems and challenges Mississippi volunteers and activists faced.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The community centers provided the most expansive attempt of what the movement perceived as possible. COFO hoped the community centers would be a "permanent institution rather than a summer 'crash' program".29 Community centers taught the kinds of practices usually associated with a welfare state -public education, job training, childcare etc. COFO sought the general improvement of the body, especially the care of the body and questions of who was responsible for the body's care. Community centers trained adults how to "provide instruction in pre-natal care, infant care, and general hygiene" (SCLC 4-2). They also included "job training, classes for people who cannot read or write, classes on childcare, health programs, adult education and negro history classes, music, drama, and arts and crafts workshops" (CC 1-1). Workshops focused on "family relations, federal service programs, home improvements".30 The idea was to organize a set of ethical practices to inspect the health of the bodies - self, family and friend. Community centers instructed individuals on what constituted a good and nutritious diet, in differences between carbohydrates and protein, as well as public services that ensured minimal levels of sustenance. Healthy bodies and clean bodies dissociated black stereotypes from idealized black citizenship.

              &lt;p&gt;
156
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Finally, voter registration provided the end goal of the schools and community centers. In contrast to the various teaching practices of the freedom schools and community centers, COFO's "Mississippi Handbook for Political Programs" defined the voter registration summer project as the "The stock work or ordinary voter registration is the simple day to day business of canvassing, informal teaching, and taking groups to the court house" (RS 1-3). Therefore, voter registration projects faced a different set of problems of garnering trust and "overcoming fear and apathy of Negro community" (RS 1-3). In order to gain trust, bodies must exhibit good demeanors to appear trustworthy. COFO emphasized mastering techniques of a good black self, "The worker must give the impression of being courageous but not foolhardy, competent but not all knowing. Be yourself, do your job, preach freedom, and the community will come" (RS 1-3). Specific training included how to listen, what to listen for, knowing when to talk and how to talk when canvassing for prospective voter registrants. Next, I will show COFO used the freedom summer programs to train and shape the black body capable of exhibiting good civic practice. Citizenship Tasks, Listening and Speaking
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The freedom schools used the same techniques as SCLC's citizenship schools to improve reading and writing skills. In order to improve the mind (perception, interpretation) COFO emphasized learning through the active body. For example, the suggested tasks for improving reading and writing were, "report for, and edit, a newspaper to exchange with other freedom schools" and "report
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
157
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
or exchange information (e.g. their work on voter registration)". Similar to SCLC's citizenship schools, COFO used tasks that prepared blacks for the nuances of political organizing. COFO instructed blacks on the practice of editing newspapers, which allowed blacks to comment on the political state of black Mississippi in a way that distinguished them as serious and professional. Learning how to publish periodicals, report and exchange information trained black students for much of movements' groundwork - local voter organizing and canvassing black neighborhoods. While students engaged in the tasks and discussed 'new ideas', Teachers were encouraged to "praise people freely. Compliment them for any small thing".32 Teachers 'praised' to overcome student shyness, timidity to build up feelings of competence while learning how to complete political tasks.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Good listening and speaking skills prepared activists for political activity in Mississippi. COFO published an "Overview of the Political Program" for volunteers and teachers. It contained a subsection "Techniques for Field Work" that defined issues pertaining to safety, the right way to canvass and run a workshop (CC 1-3). COFO instructed, "You should try to present yourself in a way that will make them want to talk with you". Canvassers should avoid associations of being timid and obnoxious in order to project a strong and courteous self. For instance, COFO instructed that "If a person closes the door in your face or will not talk with you, try to find out [sic] selsewhere why he did it. Everybody can be approached, but it may take much time and patience to reach

              &lt;p&gt;
some people" and "If a person talks but show obvious reluctance, don't force a long explanation on them. Come back another day... This builds confidence and builds a relationship". Thus, the freedom schools trained volunteers to master a style of listening and speaking to 'read' what local blacks said, and more importantly, what was not said, to organize black Mississippians politically.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
COFO trained the body on how to be a good listener in a racially ordered political culture. For example, COFO suggested that teachers that they emphasize practicing good listening skills in informal settings. "Cultivate this attitude of respect and real listening and honest answering right down to the bone. It's very hard to listen - practice it over the lunch table. But listen actively, not passively".33 COFO emphasized good listening because it was vital to the quality of information collected by volunteers working in the black community and establishing trust between civil rights workers and local black residents. A good listener signified the sense that the listener understood and sympathized with the plight of rural blacks. Based on SNCC's leadership training, COFO instructed future field workers how to interpret was blacks were implicitly telling them. It may not be what a local black resident says, but how they said it, that a volunteer based their interpretation on. When interacting with local black residents, COFO emphasized to "keep listening, and remember that fear will often cause words to mask real responses and that you must learn to hear what is beneath the words."34 Many local black residents, especially in places like northern Mississippi, feared talking or cooperating with civil rights activists because of the

159
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
likelihood whites would respond violently. They especially told white volunteers what they wanted to hear to make the white volunteers leave. Being a good listener was the best technique to convince the local black residents that civil rights workers could be trusted.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to being a good listener, COFO trained the body to be a good speaker. A good speaker articulated their thoughts and opinions in a clear and concise way. COFO instructed teachers to use caution when correcting speech. COFO teaching suggestions advised "I would suggest not correcting grammar or spelling for the first few days unless a student asks you to (and means it)".35 Because how one speaks and pronounced words is so tightly wound with perceptions of intelligence, correcting how one speaks seemed abrasive, and was counterproductive to getting blacks to attend. Nevertheless, mastering a clear, concise, and articulate style speech was necessary for success management of the press, managing other civil rights workers under ones supervision, and putting together a mass meeting or workshop to attract others to join the movement. Free Southern Theatre and Role Playing
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In order to practice deracialized techniques of self, freedom schools combined role-playing with theatre. Theatrical performances, dubbed "Free Southern Theatre" were workshops that put on plays in relation to the history of southern black-white relations36.   COFO noted, "The workshops will serve not
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
"Non-Material Teaching Suggestions for Freedom Schools" located in CC 1-2 36 For example, one freedom summer teacher noted how "we used role playing a lot. Kids would portray three generations of Negro families, and we learned history that way. We sat in a circle
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
160
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
only to educate the audience of the theatre, but will serve also to strengthen the relationship of the free southern theatre its audience, and will stimulate the growth of indigenous community theatre".37 One popular play, called "In White America", told the history of America through the standpoint of black Americans. In contrast to stories of Thomas Jefferson as the father of American democracy, the play emphasized Jefferson as a racist slave owner. Marcus Garvey, Fredrick Douglas and Nat Turner were freedom-fighting heroes, not violent revolutionaries. A student actress by the name of Denise Moses portrayed a black women testifying in court about how she was beat by the clan simultaneously representing blacks as victims and courageous heroes in the play.38 Freedom theatre practiced acts of courage and standing up for oneself, to lesson feelings of intimidation and fear when confronting bad whites.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
While the theaters aim was to tell a southern story from the black point of view, learning how to act was important for learning how to manipulate the body and manage emotions. Role-playing situations allowed blacks to apply their 'acting skills' to simulated interactions involving black civil rights workers and the press, the police use of violence, canvassing for registered voters, and dealing with bad whites. For instance, COFO trained and prepared students on how to manage the press. One student took on the role of 'activist' while another student took on the role of 'reporter'. SNCC activists had to master a set of specific questions.   They ranged from questions dealing with specifics of the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
rather than the usual classroom format, to stress the equality between the teacher and the student" (quoted in Zinn [1965]: 2002: 249)

movement "What would you say if a reporter asked you about COFO practices?" and "What would you do if a reporter asked you what do you expect out the summer project?" Other questions dealt with how reporters fished for internal conflict or race baited, questions such as "Do you think the summer project was a good idea?", "Do you like working with Negroes", "Have you found that most Negroes are dirty?", "Are negroes staying with white boys and girls?"39 COFO expected activists to master a set of answers that would not provide 'ammunition' to white adversaries. It was important not to confirm black stereotypes of blacks as dirty, or that they may find it difficult or unpleasant to work with them. Of special concern was managing the interracial sex question. It was important for activists not to confirm (nor deny) that black men were sharing social space with white females. Bad whites may perceive white men interacting with blacks as race traitors. However, acknowledgement of black men and white women sharing social space could initiate a systematic lynching of black men. Since the Klan was indiscriminate on lynching, this jeopardized all black men in the community. Community Centers: The Racial-Biopolitics of Diet and Family Care
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In some respects, freedom summer was a continuation of what the movement as a whole was doing with citizenship schools, socio-dramas and leadership training. The community centers differed because they focused on issues of the body and public health. COFO collected and analyzed data related to black bodies and population. For instance, COFO published and distributed booklets like "The General Condition of the Mississippi Negro" in October 1963, 39 "Possible Role Playing situations" located in RS 1-11
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
162
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
where they detailed birth rated, death rates and infant mortality rates of the southern black population (CC 1-1). COFO volunteers researched ideas such as school lunch programs in Greenwood, and public health programs in Jackson Mississippi".40 The community centers attempted to improve the body's health by teaching public health practices and care for the body. It is important to note that federal nutrition programs, such as Women, Infants and Children (WIC) did not start until 1972, and the first Head Start programs, public pre-school, not until 1965. Thus, the COFO community centers established a new idea of the relationship between the healthy black body and society.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The community centers trained blacks on medical care of the body. Medical care of the body focused on immediate practices of prenatal care and infant care, to governmental responsibilities of sanitation and which public health services".41 They focused on medical care because of the generally poor health conditions, a lack of medical service in the black community, and lack of knowledge on how to use medical services in the rural black community. COFO reported Southern blacks faced a nutritional crisis and food shortage. "An adequate diet for the Mississippi Negro is available for brief periods only when they are recipients of government commodities and when the tenant farmer sells his cotton", and, "Even when food is available it is in the form of most poverty diets, high in starch and low in protein".42 Improving the physical health of bodies deracialized the visual presentation of they body.

              &lt;p&gt;
COFO used medical discourse as an attempt to better the immediate lives
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
of blacks. This included an idea of what constituted a proper diet, "dietary levels
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
are measured by two criteria: calorie intake (quantity) and nutritional content
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
(quality)".43 Racial poverty for black Mississippians meant, "Surviving off one
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
meal a day, adults going without so that children may eat - in short, it meant
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
starving".44  Black southerners faced a diet that "Even when people get enough
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
feed, it is largely starches and fats. There is great reliance on corn, bread, sweet
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
potatoes, rice and fat or side pork".45 The community centers sought to improve
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the physical health of the body by teaching a more diversified and balanced diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
They concluded
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The poor in Mississippi do not get enough protein, calcium, essential vitamins and minerals for proper nutrition. Out goal, of course, is to see that these people are ultimately paid a living wage - but malnutrition can be cut down by distribution of a few food commodities and massive distribution of inexpensive vitamins.46
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Improving the body's food and nutritional content placed the responsibility for the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
care of the body as that of individuals and government.   Community centers
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
provide the former. They instructed what constituted a good diet, in appropriate
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
levels of protein, fat and carbohydrates, as well as how to obtain public food

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Deracializing strategies fixated on cleaning the black body, including
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
dressing the body in clean clothes.   Fashion, the clothes one wears and when
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
they wear them, distinguished good black citizens from bad black citizens.   For
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
instance,  a  COFO  noted  how Mississippi  blacks needed  clean  clothes to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
overcome black stereotypes,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Mothers do not go around the house in dirty robes or ragged dresses or event their slips because they are basically unclean, but because they have nothing to change into. Fathers don't lounge around on the filthy smelly overalls the work in during the day because they are too lazy to change their clothes, but because they have nothing else to put on.47
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Thus, COFO suggested organizing a clothing program to provide Mississippi
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
blacks with clean clothes, and clothes for each social context (e.g. church, work,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
home, shopping etc).  It was one thing to get dirty from a hard days work, but to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
come home and remain in the clothes signified bad citizens - dirty and unkempt.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
We can see from the above quote that COFO was aware of the need to convince
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
volunteers and civil rights workers that these stereotypes were unwarranted.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Since virtually all civil rights activists, black or white, came from urban areas, they
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
had to be prepared for the 'extremes' of rural black poverty.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Medical practices and the care of the body intertwined with ideas of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
cleaning the physical environment. The community centers instructed blacks on
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
home-repair for men, and sewing for women.48 Good citizenship regulated the

              &lt;p&gt;
proper gender roles in relation to the home and stability of the black family.

Good black men should work outside the home, both in the labor market but also on the physical exteriority. Good black women should work in the home, both in care of the children and ensuring the cleanliness of the interior. The art of maintaining ones home had two implications. First, COFO publications reported that the 1960 census showed "that in Mississippi, 66% of all Negro housing was dilapidated or deteriorating" and "more that 90% of rural Negroes homes in Mississippi have neither flush toilets nor bathing, or shower facilities".49 Fixing up ones home in part meant bringing it into the modern world of sanitation. Of course, blacks could not erect their own sewer system or generate electricity. Through political organization, they could pressure the state to provide public services to good citizens. Secondly, the art of maintaining ones home was an important craft to master when integrating white neighborhoods. It debunked black stereotypes that they did not care about the appearances of their homes. The Biopolitics of 1964 Mississippi
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Improving the care and health of the body influenced what kind of rights they demanded. We can see the how the focus on improving the body's health influenced the types of rights asked for in "1964 Platform of the Mississippi Freedom School Convention". Rather than just voting rights, black Mississippians demands ranged from public sanitation, the improvement of housing conditions, changing educational practices and curriculum, and health care services. The demand for the right to a healthy life illustrated how the care

166
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
of the body organized the movement perception of what they expected out of government, and what was government's idealized role in society.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The Mississippi Freedom School Convention called for improvements in the physical environment. The body experiences the physical environment through its auditory, visual and olfactory senses. Bad visual 'landscapes' and smells radiating from sewage and garbage impact both quality of life and how citizens perceive their social positioning in society. The Mississippi Freedom School Convention called for city financing of "paving and widening the streets and installing drainage systems in them" and a "Better system of garbage disposal, including more frequent pickups" (RS 1-4). In addition to cleaning the physical environment, they also asked for a "building code for home construction" that ensured all homes in the black community would have a complete bathroom kit, kitchen sink, central heating systems, insulated walls and ceiling, and at least three electrical outlets in the living room (RS 1-4). While housing upkeep was the responsibility of blacks, they suggested that there be "there be lower taxes on improvement in the house so that more people will fix up their homes" as well as "zoning regulations be enacted and enforced to keep undesirable and unsightly industries and commercial operations away from residential neighborhoods" (RS 1-4). Good citizens deserve to live in clean environments. Members of the Mississippi Freedom School Convention had an idea that improving health of the physical environment affected the embodied black self. The deplorable environmental conditions limited black Mississippians' perception of what was
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
167
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
possible and what opportunities existed. Thus, improving housing and the physical environment encouraged good citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Improving the physical environment also had an impact on the family. The Mississippi Freedom School Convention asked for equal opportunity buying and rent control policy. They demanded, "Slums be cleared, and a low cost federal housing project be established to help house these people" (RS 1-4). They indicated that, "The home, being the center of a child's life as well as the center of a family's must have certain facilities in order for it to be a home and not just a building in which one eats, sleeps, and prepares to leave for the rest of the day" (RS 1-4). Good citizens cannot raise good children in bad and dirty environments. Familial relationships existed within the cultural and physical environment. Families invest emotional attachment to physical space to make it a home. Demanding standards for housing construction meant blacks had the right to live in single unit houses rather than shacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The Mississippi Convention demanded changes in teaching practices and the content of educational curriculum. This meant, "That teacher brutality be eliminated" (RS 1-4). They viewed all practices of using violence to inscribe power onto the body as unjust. The state should change the educational content to prepare blacks and poor whites for a post-industrial global economy, "In an age where machines are rapidly replacing manual labor, job opportunities and economic security increasingly require higher levels of education". The Mississippi Conference observed the decline of the cotton-based economy. They recognized that blacks and poor whites would fall further behind wealthy
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
168
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
whites as an emerging global economy took shape that required intellectual and interpretive skills. Schools would have to prepare the body for an economy that devalued manual and physical labor.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Finally, the Mississippi Freedom School Convention demanded services that allowed for the improvement of the body's health and well-being. One the one hand, this meant providing authoritative medical services to inspect and provide surveillance over the body, such as "mobile units, chest x-rays, semiannually and check up at least once a year by licensed doctors, the local health department, or a clinic should be provided be the local or state government" (RS 1-4). It is the equal responsibility of government and citizens to ensure the body's health and well-being. Preventive medical treatment could improve the quality of life in parts of rural black Mississippi that did not have health care, and places were rural blacks may have never seen a doctor. One the other hand, it meant deracializing the deployment of medical services. This meant more black physicians and nurses, but also the elimination of medical-political bodily punishments, "We actually seek the abolition of any sterilization act which serves as punishment, voluntary or involuntary, for any offenses" (RS 1-4). The body should not be the site of any form of punishment. In 1964, bad white Mississippians were attempting to pass legislation that proposed "Prison or sterilization for more than one illegitimate child".50 Good citizens control their own body and make their own decisions about rearing children. In sum, in addition to the  right to vote the  Mississippi  Freedom  School  Convention

              &lt;p&gt;
169
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
demanded improved health and well-being of the body. While they viewed the care of the body as the responsibility of citizens and government, they also sought to impose limits on the state's monopoly of violence over the body. Good citizens owned their body, and teacher brutality and medical-political punishments violated this right. CONCLUSION
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The idea behind the rights projects citizenship schools and role-playing workshops, and SNCC grassroots leadership training and community centers, was to train the body on how to exhibit good bodily postures and master affective expressions to deracialize idealized good citizenship. We can isolate how the program emphasized five dimensions that represented good black citizenship. The first practice was mastering good listening and speaking skills associated with good manners. Good blacks carefully pronounced the words they were using, as well as used the correct meaning of the words. They did not use slang associated with urban or 'street corner' cultures. Good black citizens listening to what others said by looking the speaker in the eye, and waiting for the speaker to finish his or her sentence before speaking. Good manners projected a polite and cordial black self, which debunked emotional, excitable, and illiterate black stereotypes. The second practice was mastering affective responses that limited the public display of emotions. Limiting emotional response disassociated blacks from irrational stereotypes of being violent, brash, angry, and over sexualized. Good black citizens were even keeled, especially when facing tough situations, like losing a job or facing instances of racial discrimination. Third, and related to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
170
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
affective self-mastery, was mastering nonviolent practice. Being nonviolent meant 1) limiting physical responses in relation to physical violence and 2) limiting emotional verbal responses, like yelling, increase in pitch and tone of voice, and profane language, in relation to 'intense' and hostile situations. The fourth dimension was bodily practices associated with healthy bodies. This included clean bodies, clean clothes, a neat/conservative appearance, and nutritional dietary practices that incorporated protein into the diet. The healthy body was clean, groomed and physically fit, not fat nor malnourished, dirty or flashy. The idea of what counted as a well groomed and neat appearance was a contested point within the movement. The black nationalist project fiercely contested what counted as a well-groomed black body, arguing that many of the beauty products, for hair and makeup, was to lighten and even-out the black skin tone to appear more 'white'. Nevertheless, the rights and grassroots project used discourses of good black citizenship to press for a conservative look or clean and conservative dress - suits, polo shirts, slacks for men, and housedresses for women - to help blacks integrate. The last dimension was mastering good housekeeping practices. Good housekeeping was maintaining the cleanliness of the interior and exterior of ones home. Mastering good housekeeping practices represented good blacks as good neighbors. Since racial integration was part of the mainstream civil rights movements' political project, blacks had to maintain the upkeep on ones home to convince whites that neighbors cared about their home and property values.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
171
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
These five dimensions of good black citizenship produced the idea of a deracialized black political agent. This was important for 1) discussing matter of common concern 2) networking with other blacks and whites, 3) appealing to a broad constituency when running for political office, and making additional claims for rights. The rights project urged mastering deracialized techniques of self as part of obtaining access to the public sphere, and having their participation be meaningful and effective. Rational political dialog should be cordial, with the emphasis on strength of argument rather that class position or racial characteristics51. Good manners, a lack of emotional outbursts, and the proper pronunciation and use of words organized how good citizens maintain rational dialog. In addition to social positioning, an important part of social networking was the social ethical practices, how one interacted with others, which formed connections and bonds that to establish social cohesion within and between groups. Because power relations historically constructed and 'ranked' whites as superior to blacks, the responsibility was on blacks to master deracialized techniques of self when sharing social space and networking with whites. Politically, blacks who mastered techniques of good black self were more likely to form political coalitions with other blacks and whites. Since blacks are a numerically minority in the United States, they burdened the responsibility of appealing to white support to govern integrated and cosmopolitan communities.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
There were two key limitations to the rights project's citizenship schools. The changes in American political culture, especially overt racial discrimination,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
51 Here, I am drawing from how Habermas [1962] 1991 argued that an idealized public sphere operated, rather than how it may operate
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
172
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
related to the movement's success also opened space for new forms of white resistance and for the increasing influence of discourses of black authenticity. The first limitation of the citizenship school was instructing non-violent practice in relation to southern public demonstrations. When the movement switched their focus to northern urban ghettos and ideas of combating poverty, mastering nonviolence practices became less important with a lack of violent adversaries. The movement succeeded in changing southern political culture, in that it lessened the use of violence as a strategy to control blacks. The second limitation was that the citizenship schools focused on instructing deracialized techniques of self in relation to disassociating black stereotypes associated with illiteracy. The voting rights act eliminated the use literacy tests for voter registration, thus, downplaying the need for overcoming illiteracy for political reasons. Illiterates could vote, therefore, they could not use learning to read to shape a civic vocabulary to understand the struggle for civil rights. Because the citizenship schools lessons were ordered, mastering personal ethics preceded social and civic ethical practices, and the focus of mastering personal ethics was practiced in relation to illiteracy, the citizenship schools lost their starting point. In order to overcome these limitations, SCLC would have had to reframe their reasons why blacks needed to master techniques of good black self by emphasizing in terms of urban revitalization and inclusion into political parties. That is, they needed a concrete issue to wrap their program around, like voting rights or ending racial violence, rather than abstract issues, like 'world peace' or 'eliminating poverty', which seemed unattainable and Utopian.  While SCLC did
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
173
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
attempt to integrate stores with products from black owned businesses and start a poor people's movement, they did not have a model to draw from on how to revitalize black communities or create jobs.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The changing political culture open possibilities for SNCC to ask questions of whether nonviolence, working with whites, and deracialized techniques of self was still a preferable and effective mobilization strategy for racial equality. By the Freedom Summer of 1964, we could already see how SNCC started to emphasize blacks identifying as a group, defined by local geopolitical boundaries and still interracial, as opposed to the idea good citizens attached to American nationhood, bounded by idealized American civic norms, values and beliefs. It is this shift to identifying as a group, which preceded SNCC adoption of the black nationalist project, that opened up space for SNCC to use discourses of black authenticity to begin considering blacks as first and foremost part of a racial group, then American citizens. While SCLC did not have an urban revitalization or economic growth models to draw from, SNCC did have the competing black nationalist project, specifically the Nation of Islam and movement intellectuals like Malcolm X, to draw from to attach blacks to an idea of racial authenticity. As I will show in chapter 5, SNCC forced the civil rights movement to answer questions of intra-group boundaries - how to handle blacks that did not conform to good black citizenship, who could not or did not want to practice nonviolent civic ethics or integrate with whites. Rather than focus their resources on developing revitalization models, the rights project had to take a step back and face a challenge that blacks needed to emphasize the idea of the racial group,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
174
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
rather than the deracialized individual, to provide the best way to further racial equality.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
CHAPTER   4:   THE   BLACK   NATIONALIST   POLITICAL   PROJECT   AND DISCOURSES OF BLACK AUTHENTICITY
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Despite the rights project dominating 1960s public discourse on the race question, the black nationalist political project challenged the rights project's idea of what counted as good black citizenship. Unlike the rights project's use of discourses of good black citizenship that attempted to deracialize American citizenship, the black nationalist political project used discourses of black authenticity to argue that struggles for equality and citizenship rights in American have always been racially based. Rather than fashion a set of ethical practices around an idealized good citizen, the black nationalist project suggested that the blacks struggle for racial equality should be organized around the idea of an "authentic black self". The idea behind the authentic black self was that blacks had to rediscover a set of black practices uncorrupted by whiteness. As I show below, this included learning or rediscovering black history in American culture, abstaining from bodily mutilations, and rejecting religions, economic and political systems associated with whiteness.52 A consistent pattern in black nationalist thought is the practice of "recovering" a pre-discursive black body uncorrupted by white cultures that represented a glorious and powerful black self. The black nationalist project used the idea of an authentic black self to produce and distinguish a normative ideal of the revolutionary black political agent from ideas of whiteness and the deracialized black self. Thus, rather than rank blacks based on how much they reflected an idealized good citizen, discourses of black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
52 For example, the Nation of Islam rejected American nationhood and Christianity because they considered them white cultural practices.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
176
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
authenticity ranked black citizenship based on how much they abstain from associations of whiteness and represented an arbitrary idea of black authenticity.53
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The black nationalist project differed significantly from the rights project in how they approached citizenship and made symbolic citizenship claims. As the previous three chapters argue, the rights project used discourses of good black citizenship to shape a rhetoric of describing and defining blacks as good citizens, as well as how to master bodily postures and affective self mastery, in order to attach the idea of good black citizenship with the dominant representation of what black citizenship should be. The rights project, which drew from liberal ideas of citizenship, emphasized the importance of the individual. In contrast, the black nationalist project challenged the rights project on the grounds that citizenship was the property of groups, and primarily racial groups.54 For the black nationalist project, American citizenship excluded all blacks, regardless if they mastered deracialized techniques of self or if they were wealthy, based on their ascribed status. Therefore, the black nationalist project made symbolic citizenship claims by attaching their idea of black authenticity to the racial group. Once blacks identified as black first, and American second, the black nationalist project assumed blacks would begin to build up financial resources and political power, then associate with whites on the political level as equals. That is, blacks
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Indeed, the Nation of Islam viewed communism and socialism as 'white ideology' and Christianity as a white religion or slavery and death (see Lincoln 1961: 18, 28, 119). 54 For example, in 1967, Stokely Carmichael remarked to black students that, "You had better recognize that individualism is a luxury that black students can no longer afford. You had better understand that. You had better begin to see yourself as a people, and as a group, and therefore you need to help advance that group" (Carmichael [1967] 1969: 123).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
177
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
would become a part of the American polity, but would not assimilate into it, after they had built up enough political and economic power. Thus, the differences in how each project approached citizenship reflect the differences in liberal understandings of citizenship that defines citizenship as the property of autonomous individuals, and multicultural understandings of citizenship that critiques universalizing ideals of citizenship in favor of defining citizenship as the property of social groups (see Young 1990, Kymlicka 1994).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The black nationalist project understood citizenship as the property of groups because of how they understood the history of American political life and racial and ethic groups. Black nationalists told the story of upward social mobility, 'the American dream', in racial terms rather than individuals working hard to achieve economic gains. For them, white ethnics groups improved their social standing by organizing by homogenous racial groups. They saw 'Irish' and 'Italians' living and policing their own neighborhoods, patronizing their own stores, and eventually electing 'Irish' and 'Italian' city councilmen and mayors. Despite never assimilating like white ethnic groups, they saw 'Jews' and 'Chinese' as successful because they ran their own family businesses, in their own neighborhoods. Thus, the black nationalist political project used their interpretation of a homogenous intra-racial group strategy of white ethnics and Jews as a model to emulate for their own path to gaining power, not assimilation, before proceeding with ideas of civic participation. The black nationalist project maintained that the best approach to racial equality and debunking harmful black stereotypes was by distinguishing blacks as a distinct racial group.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
178
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Although both political projects struggled to defy black stereotypes, their differences stem from an idea of mastering techniques of self in relation to attaching the individual to an idealized American nationhood versus mastering techniques of self that attached the individual to the racial group. On the one hand, each political project organized a set of practices for blacks to master. The rights political project attempted to deracialize American citizenship by establishing at set of ethical practices for both blacks and whites to exhibit. They concentrated their political efforts at excluding irrational political practices, like physical and verbal attacks, in place of rational dialog that provided 'common ground' for civic inclusion. Since the idea of rejecting whiteness was a given, the black nationalist political project concentrated on intra-group, or black-black relations. Before blacks could engage whites as equals, they must first purify and 'resolve' conflicts with the self and other blacks. That is, they must learn about a separate black cultural history that distinguished a proud history of resistance against white domination.55 Although some practices overlapped, especially with ideas of conservative dress and the maintenance of heteronormative black families, the practices represented something different depending on the political project. The rights project instructed a set of personal ethical practices, such as abstaining from flashy styles of dress, to help blacks integrate  into American  society.     In  contrast,  the  black  nationalist project
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
A common theme in Malcolm's text was linking blacks to the violent and revolutionary aspects of anti-slavery movements: "When we send our children to school in this county they learn nothing about us other than that we used to be cotton pickers. Every little child going to school thinks his grandfather was a cotton picker. Why, your grandfather was Nat Turner; your grandfather was Toussaint L'Ouverture; your grandfather was Hannibal" (Malcolm [1964] 1992c: 65).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
179
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
instructed, in some instances, a similar set of personal ethical practices to keep whites away, especially government administrators, in order to help black establish sovereignty and racial separation, which represented a revolutionary black political agent.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
This chapter examines, first, how the black nationalist project used an idea of black authenticity as a discursive strategy to obtain power in place of civic inclusion. Based on primary source text (speeches, writings, editorials) and secondary historical source material, I focus on how the Nation of Islam and Malcolm X, the most popular post-war black nationalist project, represented how the black nationalist project arises in relation to deracialized and rights discourses. Since the Nation of Islam was a secret and exclusionary organization, they did not leave a textual archival legacy. Indeed, C. Eric Lincoln, who did a participatory study on the Nation of Islam in the early 1960s, noted that the Nation of Islam's passed along their core doctrine orally (see Lincoln 1961, also Beynon 1938). I will focus primarily on how Malcolm X used discourses of black authenticity to suggest the black nationalist political project as an alternative to the rights project. My purpose here differs from other research and scholarly work on Malcolm X. Scholarly writing on Malcolm and the civil rights movement have focused on his use of black nationalism as a political ideology (Sales 1994). Others have argued that Malcolm's ideas began to overlap with the mainstream civil rights project by his and King's assassination, and that common ground between the two political projects could have been sought (Lomax [1968] 1987, Cone 1991, DeCaro 1996).   Nevertheless, my objective
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
180
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
here is not an extensive analysis of the organization, or the Nation of Islam as a 'millenarian' cult (see Lee 1996), nor do I spend time with detailed nuances of his thought, but rather focus on his normative arguments and the cultural ideas Malcolm and the Nation of Islam represented. Indeed, subsequent black nationalist groups, including SNCC, and the Black Panthers, drew almost exclusively from Malcolm's articulation of the black nationalist normative black political agent after the 1965 Voting rights act (see Chapter 5)56.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The second half of the chapter focuses on SNCC's transformation to a black nationalist project. Scholars have theorized SNCC's transformation in terms of the tightening of the organizational structure (McAdam 1999), shifts in black ideology (Blumberg 1984), motivations and psychological states (Haines 1988) rival black intellectuals (Eyerman and Jamison 1991) or changes in the 'symbolic resonance' of grassroots projects and participatory styles of democracy (Polletta 2000). These studies fail to note that 1) SNCC continued to use 'grassroots' organizing practices even after adopting the black nationalist project, 2) that the centralization of authority in SNCC did not change the autonomy of political cells in Alabama or Atlanta and 3) the presence of rival intellectuals like Adam Clayton Powell and Malcolm X since the late 1950s. Scholars that propose that SNCC changed because of shifts in black ideology or symbolism fail to say how those shifts arose, were constructed, what they produced, and the relationship of the differing ideology to the history of black political thought and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
56 Franz Fanon's Wretched of the Earth was the other important text for the black nationalist groups of the 1960s. However, it appealed primarily to those attempting to organize around ideas of pan-Africanism, which competed with ideas of black capitalism for influence within the black nationalist project.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
181
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
protest. In contrast to previous studies, I will explain how SNCC used discourses of black authenticity to reinterpret the difficulties associated with their grassroots political project, which along with their geographical style of organizing autonomous political cells, led to their adoption of the black nationalist project. I use comparative methods to show the differences in how SNCC used discourses of good black citizenship versus how they used discourses of black authenticity to understand how they answered questions of mastering techniques of authentic black self, which changed how they approached their relationship with whites, and how they shaped black civic practices. In sum, this chapter illustrates that the black civil rights ethical practices are not autonomous from the discursive political projects, and that American movements can draw from alternative understanding of citizenship, American cultural features, and global racial struggles. Next, I will outline how the black nationalist political project defined a set of techniques of authentic black self as an alternative political practice for achieving racial equality. THE NATION OF ISLAM AND TECHNIQUES OF AUTHENTIC BLACK SELF
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The history of the black nationalist political project in black political struggles is one of emerging and responding to the dominant integration and rights projects. In the mid-1800s, Martin Delaney challenged Fredrick Douglas over the issue of integration and argued that blacks should create a separate black nation (see Cruse 1967). Black nationalism became an influential alternative in the 1930s depression era urban black culture. Detroit, Michigan, in particular,  had several black nationalists groups competing for influence -
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
182
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
including a chapter of Marcus Garvey's United Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), the Moorish Science Temple Movement, The Nationalist Movement for the Establishment of a Forty-Ninth State, The National Union of People of African Descent, and The Nation of Islam, to name a few (see Beynon 1938, Lincoln 1961, Cruse 1967). The early Nation of Islam, of the 1930s, drew many of their recruits from southern blacks who migrated to the North (Beynon 1938). In contrast, Lincoln noted that in the 1950s and 1960s, 80% of the Nation of Islam's members were between 17-35, predominately male and lower class (1961: 23-27). Of the many black nationalist groups of the 1930s, only the Nation of Islam survived. Despite group competition for influence over the urban black community, each black nationalist group sought to obtain power by first creating an idea of an authentic black culture that rejected associations with whiteness. This meant emphasizing symbolic identifications with Africa, physical separation from whites, and rejecting Christian religious beliefs and practices. Although groups came and went, and membership never approached the levels of the NAACP, the black nationalist political project was important for representing a racializing strategy that sought power through cultural and political sovereignty.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
One of the reasons the Nation of Islam outlasted their contemporary black nationalist organizations were its schools and internal police force that instructed blacks how to practice their idea of an authentic black self, and punished them when they violated its strict rules. The Nation of Islam organized the 'University of Islam' and 'Muslim Girl Training Class' to teach black history, how to speak Arabic, and in the Girls training school, the proper way to clean a house, sew,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
183
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
cook a Muslim meal, and take care of children (see Lincoln 1961, Malcolm [1965] 1999). The police force, which went by the name 'Fruit of Islam', was responsible for administering judgment and punishment for any Nation of Islam member who violated the group's strict cultural codes. Lincoln noted that The Fruit of Islam read the charges then pronounced the verdict; defendants were not allowed to present their case (1961: 199-203). Violations that led to punishments, which ranged from performing manual labor at a local Muslim temple to expulsion from the group, included misusing temple funds, using narcotics, sleeping during meetings, eating/selling pork, being overweight and disrespecting Muslim women (Lincoln 1961: 201). In addition to their schools and police force, the Nation of Islam used theatrical performances to celebrate the superiority of an authentic black culture. One play title Orgena, written by Louis Farrakhan, portrayed a black lawyer convicting 'the white man' for being, among other things, the greatest liar, drunkard, gambler, peace-breaker and troublemaker on earth (see Lincoln (1961: 3). Thus, the Nation of Islam used formal and informal means to discipline black ethical bodily practices to represent an idea of authentic black self. Along with an analysis of how Malcolm represented the black nationalist project, I will show how the Nation of Islam produced a normative idea of authentic blackness and accompanying set of authentic black personal, social, and civic ethical practices. Discourses of Black Authenticity and Personal Ethics
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The Nation of Islam guided their followers and recruits on how to master a set of personal ethical practices in relation to an idea of black authenticity. They
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
184
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
used discourses of black authenticity to produce a set of personal ethical practices, the relationship black had with the self, which distinguished a normative idea of authentic blackness from the deracialized black self and associations of whiteness. The idea was that all blacks, especially black addicts, dealers, pimps and prostitutes confined to the extreme margins of society, needed to improve their personal ethical practices. Indeed, Malcolm approached the black nationalist political project as a self-help project, "We need a self-help program... Black nationalism is a self help philosophy. This is a philosophy that eliminates the necessity for division and argument, so that if you're black, you should be thinking black" (Malcolm [1964] 1968: 208). Indeed, the Nation of Islam used discourses of black authenticity to organize personal ethical practices that limited and excluded all associations with whiteness, including Christianity, Marxism, and any political strategy that sought civic inclusion. For the Nation of Islam, the prolonged exposure to an inferior white culture has created a docile black subject not capable of thinking or practicing as a black man, "The Negro's position is most strategic, but his mental condition is too pathetic for him to take intelligent advantage of this vital position 'fate' has placed him in. The American Negro is suffering from a mental sickness" (Malcolm [1960] 1964: 311). In order to cleanse black citizenship, the black nationalist project sought to limit personal ethical practices corrupted by whiteness that led blacks to a life of vice and crime, which reproduced blacks subordinate social positioning to whites. Malcolm, especially, viewed the improvement of personal ethical practices as 'foundational' for a uniform and unified black identity (Malcolm [1963] 1992a:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
185
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
147). Thus, the Nation of Islam defined techniques of self as what blacks should abstain from in order to purify the black body from whiteness.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In contrast to the mainstream civil rights movement, the black nationalist political project rejected the idea that blacks' exhibiting idealized good citizen practices was enough, "This young Negro educator in Georgia - he wasn't ragged, he wasn't uncouth, he wasn't uncivilized; he was an educator, he was as uppity and dicty as they were - and they still shot him. Why? Because he had nothing behind him. His education couldn't save him" (Malcolm [1964] 1992b: 159). Malcolm used discourses of black authenticity to argue that good speaking skills and a neat and clean body was not enough for racial equality. Black Americans would always be black first, then American citizens. We can isolate the types of personal ethical practices the Nation of Islam used to instruct their members on how to refrain from deracializing the black self and how to limit the harmful effects of white culture on blacks. Specifically, they instructed and enforced ascetic practices of 1) mastering the desire of 'improper' bodily pleasures 2) eliminating bodily mutilation and 3) shaping bodily postures that represented an authentic black subject.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The Nation of Islam outlined a set of acceptable and forbidden pleasures relating to the body - dietary, sexual, and the consumption of vice - in relation to improving black hygiene and care of the self, in order to produce a healthier and authentically black physical body. Part of improving the black mind and body was changing his or her eating practices. Authentic blacks mastered their desires for 'slave foods'. The Nation of Islam had strict dietary guidelines for all
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
186
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
members. Nation of Islam members were required to fast three days each month. Meals were limited to one a day, at sundown, consisting mostly of beans and vegetables. Restrictions on food sought to "eliminate physical and mental sluggishness and leaves more time for industry" (Lincoln 1961: 81). Black Muslims could not eat any hog, duck, goose, possum or catfish. Nor could they eat black-eyed peas or cornbread. The only animals black Muslims consumed were the lamb, the chicken and the cow. The Nation of Islam penalized black Muslims, by fine, if they were overweight. The Nation of Islam dietary restrictions all reflect abstinence from the typical rural black cuisine in southern geopolitical cultures. The idea behind dietary restrictions was to cleanse the body from associations with slavery and southern black rural culture historically dominated and corrupted by whites. However, dietary restrictions produced a strong and healthy black body that could work efficiently toward building and idealized black only community. Authentic blackness rejected the fat, lazy, dirty, and unhealthy associations of rural blacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The Nation of Islam emphasized the need to master personal ethical practices of abstaining from certain bodily pleasures associated with 'social vice', specifically marijuana, cocaine, heroin, tobacco and alcohol, because vice was defined as white and "western" pleasures (see Malcolm [1961] 1998: 234). The Nation of Islam approached addiction as producing an unproductive and corrupted bodily subject - the "prostitute", the "juvenile delinquent", the "fornicator" (see Malcolm [1963] 1992a: 111). They used discourses of black authenticity to rehabilitate the black body, corrupted by the vices of white culture,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
187
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and transformed it from a liability into an asset.    Malcolm noted that Islam
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
supplied better personal ethical practices to 'rehabilitate' the black body than the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
rights project,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Complete separation; not only physical separation but moral separation. This is why the Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches black people in this country that we must stop drinking, we must stop smoking, we must stop committing fornication and adultery, we must stop gambling and cheating and uses profanity, we must stop showing disrespect for our women, we must reform ourselves as parents so we can set the proper example for our children. Once we reform ourselves of these immoral habits, that makes us more godly, more godlike, more righteous (Malcolm 1963: (Clark Interview): 141).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
By abstaining from social vice, authentic blacks did not poison their bodies.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Rather, the ascetic practices created a productive body that debunked black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
stereotypes that blacks would rather get 'drunk', 'high', or shoot dice, than go to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
work. Sexual practices were strictly limited to heterosexual black men and black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
women relations.    In part, limiting sexual partners to same race/different sex
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
relations ensured a racially homogenous genetic lineage.  More importantly, the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Nation of Islam used discourses of black authenticity to argue that black men had
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
to  maser their desire for white women  because  it encouraged  other bad
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
practices.    Malcolm recounted in his autobiography how he and his friends'
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
involvement with white women reinforced their drug habits and criminal activities
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
(see Malcolm [1965] 1999: 133-153).   Refraining from vice and limiting sexual
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
practice to black men and black women was important for building separate black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
communities. It helped stabilize heteronormative black families and directed
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
excess  money to  black owned  restaurants,  automobile  repair shops,  and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
188
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
temples.   Thus, the negation of vice from an idealized authentic black subject
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
was a strategy to 'grow' black communities without black dependency on whites.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The consequences for blacks not mastering personal ethical practices
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
differed between political projects.     For the rights project, failure to mater
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
techniques  of deracialized   self  meant further  segregation  and   inequality.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
However, for the black nationalist project, the failure to master desires for social
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
vice was increased black exposure to whites and increased 'white' surveillance
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
through state administrative practices.    Blacks that mastered their desire for
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
social vice kept black families in tact and themselves out of jail. It provided some
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
'invisibility' from the most hated whites - social workers and the police.  Malcolm
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
argued that because of the urban ghetto culture, blacks were,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
... exposed to every form of indecency and vice imaginable. Our young girls, our daughters, our baby sisters become unwed mothers before they are hardly out of their teens.... It becomes almost impossible to practice the rules of good hygiene. And therefore tuberculosis, syphilis, gonorrhea, and other destructive social diseases are on the rampage throughout our community (Malcolm [1963] 1989: 63-64).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition, addiction and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), left untreated,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
visibly dehabilitates the physical body.   Addiction and STDs have a 'history', in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
that they have been attached to marginalized groups to explain and justify their
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
civic exclusion57. Mastering pleasures associated with social vice was a strategy
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
to clean up the body, as in produce a physically clean and healthy body to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
remove the symbols of pollution that provided the basis for black criminal
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
stereotypes.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
57 For examples and discussion of how culture influences medical discourse, and how diseases have been fixated to specific groups to marginalize them, see Lupton 1994, Montgomery 1996, and Seidman 1997.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
189
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to refraining from improper bodily desires, the Nation of Islam
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
used discourses of black authenticity to argue against black bodily modification
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
or mutilation.  They associated bodily modification in relation to the deracialized
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
project emphasis on mastering vernacular speech patterns and limiting affective
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
responses.   In contrast, bodily mutilation was associated with whiteness, where
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
blacks attempted to alter their body's physical features to reflect the physical
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
features of whites. Authentic blacks did not modify their hair texture or skin color
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
to mimic the whites' hair and skin.  Malcolm noted that bodily mutilation was "my
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
first really big step toward self degradation: when I endured all of this pain,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
literally burning my flesh to have it look like a white man's hair" (Malcolm [1965]
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
1999: 56).   Malcolm argued that blacks' mutilated their bodies because white
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
culture associated cultural ideals of beauty exclusively with white bodies.  Blacks
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
mutilated their bodies out of shame.   This was especially true of blacks who
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
obtained higher levels of formal education.    He noted that black men who
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
attended college or universities were less racially authentic than blacks who did
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
not obtain higher education.  For example, he described black college graduates
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
as, "ashamed of what he is, because his culture has been destroyed, his identity
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
has been destroyed; he has been made to hate his black skin, he has been
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
made to hate the texture of his hair, he has been made to hate the features that
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
God gave him" (Malcolm [1962] 1969: 74).   In contrast, Malcolm portrays Elijah
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Muhammad as an authentic black leader, in part, because of his lack of formal
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
education prevented his identification with whiteness,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
They ridicule him because of his lack of education and his cotton-field origin in Georgia.   White America chooses to listen to the Negro civil
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
190
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
rights leaders, the Big Six. Six puppets who have been trained by the whites in white institutions and then placed over our people by these same whites as 'spokesmen' for our people (Malcolm [1963] 1971a: 126).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Elijah Muhammad was an authentic black man because his lack of a formal
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
educational training allowed him to interpret black bodily aesthetics as 'black is
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
beautiful'.     Malcolm  used  discourses of black authenticity to question  an
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
educational system that taught blacks to hate the racialized black self.    In
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
contrast to college-educated blacks, whom Malcolm saw as practicing techniques
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
of deracialized self, he associated blacks not educated by the American school
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
system as more authentic than educated blacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Third, Malcolm used discourses of black authenticity to argue that blacks
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
needed to improve their bodily postures.    Unlike black Americans who were
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
corrupted, demoralized and taught to hate the black self, Malcolm saw Africans
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
as exhibiting good bodily posture.   In contrast to the rights project which saw
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
good bodily posture as a sign of dignity and good American citizenship, Malcolm
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
associated good bodily postures with dignity of pre-colonial African heritage.   In
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
an attempt to recover prediscursive black bodily postures, Malcolm noted that
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
prior to being enslaved,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
You were walking erect, upright. You ever watch your walk? Now you're too hip to walk erect. You've come up with that other walk. But when you're yourself, you walk with dignity... I was amazed when I was in Africa to see the sense of poise and balance that these people over there have, all throughout Africa and Asia (Malcolm 1970: 32).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Malcolm used discourses of black authenticity to argue that real blacks' practiced good bodily postures because it represented a powerful, self-assured and self-respected black political agent.   Good bodily postures overcame the shame of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
191
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
being black.  Good posture communicated to whites that one was proud of who he or she was.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Specifically for black men, authentic black bodily postures represented hypermasculine ideals of toughness and sexual prowess. The Nation of Islam used training classes to train black Muslim men, primarily between the ages of 16-35, on practices of bodybuilding, physical hygiene, judo, military drills, and fighting with knives and black jacks, to shape a hypermasculine black body. Black male bodies should be muscular and physically intimidating. Black male bodies were disciplined to reflect, even emphasize, the black stereotypes whites feared the most. Similar to the rights political project, the black nationalist project included an idea how black men should act. The difference was how the black nationalist project used discourses of authenticity to associate black masculinity with violence, toughness to obtain power and respect, while the rights project argued that black men could still be masculine and nonviolent. Discourses of Black Authenticity and Social Ethics
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The Nation of Islam used discourses of black authenticity to organize a set of social ethical practices, how blacks should have relations with other black political groups and other racial groups. In contrast to the rights project that defined social ethical practices in terms of good manners to ensure cordial and respectful relations between individuals, black and white, in public, the black nationalist project defined social ethical practices as the relations between racial and political groups in order to obtain power. They defined racial autonomy as the starting point for social ethical practices.    On the one hand, the black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
192
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
nationalist project rejected integration because integration forced blacks to abandon black racial identifications. Whites used integration as a "trick" to keep blacks subservient to the state. Even in places where whites 'allowed' blacks to integrate, Malcolm noted that whites all moved away to the surrounding suburbs to reestablish subtle and implicit forms segregation (see Malcolm [1963] 1989: 67). On the other hand, Malcolm drew from the idea of racial autonomy as a strategy for blacks use to purify a racial identify, necessary to govern and police black communities. Since they viewed all forms of community as racially organized, it was 'logical' to allow racial groups to govern their own. Specifically for the black nationalist political project, racial separation meant, "... once the black man becomes the political master of his own community, it means that the politicians will also be black, which means that he will be sending black representatives even at the federal level" (Malcolm [1963] 1992a: 153). Although they sometimes demanded racially geographic separation, in the form of a separate nation state within the United States, they never approached this as a realistic strategy58. However, they used an idea of racial separation to fashion a set of social ethical practices to define 1) how blacks should interact with other blacks to purify an authentic black identity 2) how blacks should use and interpret other domestic and global racial group successes as 'models' for developing business and inter-group political relations.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Typical of how the black nationalist political project used an idea racial separation to shape an identity was the following utterance by Malcolm X: "I believe that a psychological, cultural, and philosophical migration back to Africa will solve our problems. Not a physical migration, but a cultural, psychological, philosophical migration back to Africa - which means restoring our common bond - will give us the spiritual strength and the incentive to strengthen our political and social and economic position right here in America" (Malcolm [1963] 1992a: 152)
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
193
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The Nation of Islam used discourses of black authenticity to define a set of social ethical practices that outlined how blacks should interact with other blacks. In contrast to how the rights project used discourses of good citizenship, which focused on the ethical relations between whites and blacks, discourses of black authenticity concentrated first on the ethical relations between blacks. The black nationalist project used discourses of black authenticity to disassociate black stereotypes attributed to the entire group, rather than stereotypes attributed to personal ethical practices. Specifically, the Nation of Islam sought to eliminate black-on-black violence. Malcolm blamed the white press for helping shaping an idealized black criminal identity that, "keeps the black community in the image of a criminal. And as soon as this impression is given, then it makes it possible, or paves the way to set up a police-type state in the Black community, getting the full approval of the white community" (Malcolm [1965] 1989a: 160). Malcolm noted that white continued to associate criminal and violent black stereotypes to blacks because they have mastered "a science that's called 'image making'. They hold you in check through this science of imagery. They even make you look down upon yourself, by giving you a bad image of yourself." (Malcolm [1965] 1989a: 160). Malcolm argued that blacks should stop fighting one another and concentrate their energies on the "real" enemy, whites, who were responsible for turning the black community on itself in order to control it. Blacks would obtain power only when they were equally willing to attack whites to claim respect as much as they are willing to attack blacks to claim respect. The black criminal may have had respect in the local black community, like Harlem, but only to the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
194
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
extent that they did not cross bad cops and organized crime bosses - who were predominantly white.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to limiting black-on-black violence, the black nationalist project defined how different black political projects should interact, so as not to present intra-group divisions and disagreements in public. Malcolm used discourses of black authenticity to emphasize that all black people faced common struggles because they were black first, therefore, they should resolve differences without whites, "Instead of airing our differences in public, we have to realize we're all in the same family. And when you have a family squabble, you don't get out on the sidewalk. If you do, everybody calls you uncouth, unrefined, uncivilized, savage" (Malcolm [1963] 1989: 251). Malcolm noted how the 1955 Bandung Conference sought a way to combat colonialism and establish national sovereignty in relation to the west. For Malcolm, it was the idea that 'people of color' got together and sought to solve their problems without whites. Indeed, the Bandung Conference did not invite nations that identified with western nations, including South Africa, Israel, and Taiwan. The Bandung Conference was important for developing ideas of 'pan-Islam' 'pan-Arabism' and 'pan-Africanism' (see Wright 1956, Kahin 1956).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The Nation of Islam organized a second set of social ethical practices that outlined how blacks should model their political strategies and interracial relations off of other 'models of racialized successes' of differing domestic and global racial group struggles. They divided domestic and global racial groups based on how each model obtained a particular 'form' of power.  Domestic racial
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
195
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
groups, including all whites, Jews, as well as Chinese and Latin American immigrants, provided a model to obtain cultural and economic power. Global racial groups, notably African and Middle Eastern anti-colonial movements, but also Native Americans, provided models to obtain political power. They considered all racial groups struggles for power as autonomous from other racial groups. The differences between domestic and global racial groups is that domestic racial groups have obtained primarily economic power in order to obtain civic inclusion, whereas global racial groups have struggled for political power to gain "freedom", or independence from the dominant racial group. Global racial struggles have embraced violence as a means to end, where domestic racial groups have used economic power to get access to political power. The black nationalist project drew from both models. The idea was that if blacks could not obtain domestic economic and political power, then blacks should use global revolutionary struggles to secure power.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The black nationalist project argued that blacks should copy how American white ethnic groups racially organized their communities to secure power. They viewed Irish, Italian and Jewish communities as racially homogenized groups that improved their social standing as a racially whole. Malcolm noted, "Every immigrant ethnic group that has come to this country is now a genuinely first-class citizen group - every one of them but the black man" (Malcolm [1963] 1992b: 128). For instance, postwar urban blacks, stretching between New York and Chicago, would have viewed Irish pubs, Italian Bakeries, Jewish Jewelers, and Polish outdoor markets as indicators of racially organized
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
196
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
communities that produced racial elites, e.g. Chicago Mayor Richard Daly. Malcolm also associated Latin American immigrants and political refugees as obtaining power like other previous white ethnic groups. Malcolm saw little distinction between Cuban and eastern Europeans. He noted that America's practice of extending benefits to non-juridical citizens provided evidence that being the good citizen was not going to help blacks. He noted, "it is not surprising that the Hungarians and Polacks and Cuban can come to this country - who have never fought for this country, who have never contributed anything to this country's economy, who have never contributed to the defense of this democracy - can come here and get all the benefits of it" (Malcolm [1963] 1971c: 110-111).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Since whites were not going to give blacks power, Malcolm used discourses of black authenticity to argue that blacks model how they built black communities after the Jews and Chinese. The Nation of Islam often drew from racial stereotypes of other groups, especially strains of anti-Semitism that portrayed Jews as greedy and money-hungry. Despite facing discrimination from white Christians, Malcolm argued that Jews became powerful because "The Jew never went sitting-in and crawling-in and sliding-in and freedom riding, like he teaches and helps Negroes do. The Jew stood up, and stood together, and they used their ultimate power, the economic weapon" (Malcolm [1963] 1992b: 117). Similarly, the Chinese obtained economic power because they governed and managed Chinese communities, "The reason Chinatown is not regarded as a segregated community is that Chinese in Chinatown control all their own
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
197
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
business, all their own banks, their own politics, their own everything, whereas
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the so-called Negro community everything is controlled by outsiders" (Malcolm
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
[1963] 1971b: 75).   Thus, the black nationalist project approached all domestic
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
racial groups as obtaining power only after they racially separated themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Although Jews and Chinese did not have the same amount of cultural inclusion
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
as Irish and Italians, they did have economic power, which made other white
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
ethnic groups respect them and grant them political access.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Global racial struggles provided a revolutionary model for obtaining power
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
if whites resisted black control over black communities.   The Nation of Islam
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
viewed the Native Americans struggle as one example of a revolutionary global
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
racial group. Although Native Americans lost, Malcolm argued whites respected
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Native Americans more than they did blacks because Native Americans used
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
violence,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The Indian is in worse shape than we are... But they [whites] have more respect for the Indians than they do for you and me. You know why? Because they fought them... Sure, they'll claim the Indians, but nobody is going to claim you and me - because we're non-violent, nobody. You're going to be a peaceful slave, a nonviolent slave. No, that Indian, brother, he drank blood, he tomahawked (Malcolm 1970: 50).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Despite Native American life on the reservation that hovered at levels of absolute
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
deprivation, Malcolm nevertheless viewed reservation life an alternative because
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
he viewed Native Americans as having the respect of whites.  Native Americans
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
fought  back,  and  whites  'rewarded'  them with  land  that  Native Americans
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
controlled.    In contrast to the rights project, which outlined idealized ethical
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
practices that blacks and whites should exhibit, the black nationalist project
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
suggested  blacks  use  racially organized  and  violent  practices  because  it
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
198
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
produced material gains, such as land and power, over symbolic gains like desegregating buses and lunch counters.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
African independence models were the other global racial struggle Malcolm suggested blacks model themselves after. How the black nationalist project drew from global struggles differed form the rights project in two key ways. First, the rights project emphasized how African nations gained freedom then incorporated into the world capitalist system. In contrast, the black nationalist project used the developing ideas of pan-Africanism to get American blacks to stop identifying as western subjects, and start identifying with other global minority group struggles. Rather than understand African nation states as joining the global world order, the black nationalist project saw the Bandung conference and pan-African ideology as proof that global black people were trying to separate and withdraw from a corrupted white-dominated global system. Second, whereas the rights project emphasized the nonviolent and democratic aspects of decolonialism, such as India, Ghana, and Kenya, the black nationalist project emphasized the violent and cleansing practices African nations practiced to rid themselves of all colonial residue. For Malcolm, African colonial struggles also provide an alternative model for blacks to draw from: "And when you see that you've got problems, all you have to do is examine their historic method used all over the world by others who have problems similar to yours. Once you see how they got theirs straight, then you know how you can get yours straight (Malcolm [1963] 1991: 253). Malcolm used discourses of black authenticity to depict anti-colonial struggles, such as the Mau Mau in Kenya, as a struggle
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
199
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
between two races. The Mau Mau used violence to overthrow Europeans and answer questions of land squatters, unemployment, lack of housing and lack of available land in rural areas (see Maloba 1993). Part of the Mau Mau violent strategies were using the servants to kill the white families they worked for, burn down colonial huts, and killing black government workers, teachers, and African bureaucrats aligned with the British. For blacks, the African independent struggles provided an alternative to the domestic models and rights projects nonviolent struggles. If white domination and violence increases when blacks begin to obtain economic power, or if white violence continues despite black nonviolence, then blacks can look to draw from the successful African struggles to organize political and revolutionary practices. Civic Ethics
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The Nation of Islam did not directly get involved in politics. They abstained from voting or supporting any politician because they viewed every president and white politician reneging promises to help black Americans (see (Malcolm [1960] 1964: 313, Malcolm [1961] 1998: 225). However, Malcolm X articulated a set of civic ethical practices, based on the use of violence, which he presented as a strategy to neutralize white violence and as an alternative to demonstrating. The idea behind using violence was that if blacks wanted to be equal citizens, then they should use the civic practices that resonated with American white history. Malcolm argued that Americans, starting with American revolutionary heroes59,  have always used violence to solve their problems
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
59 For instance, Malcolm often used the French and American revolutions to illustrate that whites shaped the western world via violent struggles, and they have idolatrized violent men was icons.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
200
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
because violence produced a winner embodied with respect and freedom. This was especially true of civil rights struggles in the south. He argued, "It'll never get any better until our people in this country learn how to speak the same language that the racist speaks... And the language of the racist in the South is the language of violence. It's the language of brutality, and power and retaliation" (Malcolm [1964] 1992a: 169). In contrast to the rights project, Malcolm defined independence with ideas of freedom and respect. Nonviolence may win concessions from the state, but it did guarantee cultural change that defined blacks as equals.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
We see in Malcolm's text the broad use of the term violence, which I will use to refer to any practice that induces fear, through bodily and/or affective violence, in other groups, causing those groups live in shame and accept their unequal social positioning. Based on this idea of violence, we can see how Malcolm argued that blacks could only obtain power by using "operational" and "figurative" forms of violence. By operational violence, I am referring to practices of self-defense and revolution rather than practices of nonviolence and civic inclusion. By figurative violence, I am referring to mastering techniques of self that organized the body to exhibit threatening and intimidating demeanors, such as expressing emotions like anger, hate or exhibiting a 'tightly' disciplined body (e.g. military or solider like).   I used the term figurative violence to indicate how
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
A sample text is, "And you know what Patrick Henry had to do to get some respect: He said liberty or death. He didn't talk any kind of peaceful suffering or passive resistance. George Washington didn't talk peaceful suffering or passive resistance. No one here who is respected by whites ever tried to propagate some kind of peaceful suffering or passive resistance" (Malcolm [1963] 1971c: 116).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
201
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Malcolm suggested that blacks use the body, as a 'figure' that signified violence.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
For Malcolm, the overall use of violence in the black nationalist project was
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
meant to eliminate white violence targeted at blacks.   Rather than prepare the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
body to absorb physical punishment and master affective response, Malcolm
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
approached racial equality by using black violence and the appearance of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
threatening affective and bodily demeanors to neutralize the use of white
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
violence.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
One civic ethical practice associated with an idea of operational violence
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
is 'fighting  back'.    As indicated  in the previous chapter,  southern whites,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
specifically the police, sheriffs and Klan, beat, hit and hung black bodies to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
inscribe white sovereignty into southern culture.    Southern violence did not
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
'discipline' the black population, as in correcting or shaping black practices to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
coincide with a set of southern norms.  Therefore, Malcolm urged blacks not to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
hesitate to resist this particular form of domination.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Let him know you're peaceful, let him know that you're respectful and you respect him, and that you're law-abiding, and that you want to be a good citizen, and all those right-thinking things. But let him know at the same time that you're ready to do to him what he's been trying to do to you. Then you'll always have peace" (Malcolm [1964] 1992a: 176-177).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Malcolm viewed nonviolence as an idealized civic practice that did not confront
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the 'realities' of black life.  Since the government failed to protect blacks, it was
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
time for authentic black men to fight back to create a respected black self. When
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
asked if he was training blacks on "how to use knuckle-dusters and guns",
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Malcolm replied, "The black man in America doesn't need that much training.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Most of them have been in the army - have already been trained by the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
202
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
government themselves. They haven't been trained to think for themselves and,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
therefore, they've never used this training to protect themselves" (Malcolm [1965]
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
1992: 185).  For Malcolm, the question was not that the black nationalist needed
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
to prepare or train black men to fight.   Rather, the question was how use the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
violence to obtain power.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
A second civic practice associated with operational violence is revolution.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
When alternative strategies of fighting back to stop white violence and creating
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
independent political and economic power centers failed to work, Malcolm used
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
discourses of black authenticity to construct a revolutionary black political agent
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
capable of using violence to end white control over black communities.  Malcolm
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
dismissed any association of the rights political project of inclusion as a
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
revolution.     Malcolm  noted that rather that obtain  power for blacks, their
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
nonviolent practices were cementing blacks in an inferior position to whites,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The only kind of revolution that is nonviolent is the Negro revolution. The only kind of revolution in which the goal is loving your enemy is the Negro revolution. It's the only revolution in which the goal is a desegregated lunch counter, a desegregated public toilet; you can sit down next to white folks - on the toilet (Malcolm [1963] 1989: 253).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Although desegregation symbolized racial equality, Malcolm argued real blacks
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
should expect material gains.   There should be massive public investment in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black schools, elected black officials in black communities, and provisions to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
guarantee blacks jobs. Unlike the mainstream civil rights movement's claims that
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
they represented the black revolution, Malcolm responded that, "Revolutions are
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
destructive and bloody.    Revolutionaries don't compromise with the enemy"
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
(Malcolm  [1963]  1971a:   137-38).     The  idea of using  operational violence
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
203
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
preemptively was a technique of last resort.     Nevertheless, blacks should be
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
prepared to fight if whites become more aggressive at preventing blacks from
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
controlling black communities.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to using operational violence in place of nonviolent direct
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
action,  Malcolm proposed blacks should shape their bodies in  relation to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
figurative violence.   In part, Malcolm used discourses of black authenticity to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
fashion a hyper-racialized body designed to be racially threatening.  On the one
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
hand, the figurative violent body did not practice bodily mutilation. There were no
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
hair conking or hair activators.    Yet, the black nationalist project's biggest
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
opposition to the  rights  projects'  deracializing  strategy was the  idea that
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
managing affective responses 'repressed' authentic black anger that prevented
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black nationalists from mobilizing black communities. Malcolm noted,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
here the man has got a rope around his neck and because he screams, you know, the cracker that's putting the rope around his neck accuses him of being emotional. You're supposed to have the rope around your neck and holler politely, you know. You're supposed to watch your diction, not shout and wake other people up - this is how you're supposed to holler. You're supposed to be respectable and responsible when you holler against what they're doing to you... He dies with a responsible image, he dies with a polite image, but he dies. The man who is irresponsible and impolite, he keeps his life (Malcolm 1970: 21-22).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
On the one hand, Malcolm suggested that affective responses, such as anger
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and hate, signified black public renouncement of unfair treatment.   He rejected
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the rights project's techniques of good black self that limited emotional public
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
outbursts.  Malcolm read the lack of affective response as blacks accepting their
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
inferior social positioning to whites.   Training blacks to not hate was preparing
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
them to be docile and obedient to whites.  In part, fighting back, acting hysterical
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
204
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and publicly expressing one's anger was a strategy to communicate to other blacks that they were no longer to accept discriminatory treatment.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, mastering figurative violence meant using affective responses that did not represent the black man as feminine. Malcolm noted that authentic black people "are tired of following these handpicked Negro 'leaders' who sound like professional beggars, as they cry year after year for white America to accept us as first class citizens" (Malcolm [1960] 1964: 314). The black nationalist political project would force, "every one of these civil rights organizations making these Uncle Tom Negro leaders stand up and fight like men instead of running around here nonviolently acting like women" (Malcolm [1965] 1989b: 126). The black revolutionary political agent did not cry out hysterically when hit, nor did his voice rise in pitch. He did not publicly get on his knees and pray for whites because the same bodily posture of kneeling down represented begging. Therefore, Malcolm suggested blacks were better off using emotions to gain power. This included appearing angry and fed up to convince whites that they are no longer going to take abuse. Malcolm argued that whites preferred working with the mainstream civil rights groups because they did not scare anyone (Malcolm [1965] 1989a: 173). Whites 'knew' they could integrate blacks without treating them as equals. Instead, Malcolm argued whites would only negotiate with blacks once they feared them. Thus, the black nationalist project, especially with the rejection of nonviolence, sought to shape a revolutionary black political agent who physically intimated whites to prepare blacks for revolutionary struggles against whites.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
205
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to fashioning civic practices with operational and figurative
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
violence,  Malcolm proposed other alternatives to demonstrating in favor of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
challenging and confronting specific whites who 'had power'.   Authentic blacks
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
'knew' who their enemies were.  Malcolm portrayed the rights political project as
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
fighting the complexities and abstractions of power, in that they were fighting
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
ideas and cultural norms, rather than specific enemies,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The days of demonstrations and protests are over... a protest demonstration is an act that is a reaction to what someone else has done... we don't go to just to walk around the block with a sign. No, we go to get the one who harmed us - that's a demonstration, that's what's known as positive action... If we're going to demonstrate, it should be a demonstration based upon no-holds-barred" (Malcolm [1964] 1992d: 105-106).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The black nationalist project argued blacks should direct their protest practices
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and resources at powerful and influential whites and material forms of white
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
power, such as white police and police stations, white landlords, white schools
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and their school superintendents etc.    In part, the black nationalist project
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
suggested fighting for influence locally rather than seek national reforms because
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
blacks were more likely enjoy the immediate benefits of a black sheriff, black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
schoolteacher, and black home ownership.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Although Malcolm rejected the rights project's approach, he did support
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and admire how SNCC drew from a grassroots project to organize black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Mississippians.  Rather than an integrated struggle, Malcolm felt there should be
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
"racially paralleled" efforts - equal, but never intersecting.  Malcolm commended
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SNCC's efforts in rural Mississippi because, "They're not trying to integrate,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
they're trying to get our people registered to vote, which is good, because it puts
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
206
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
them in a position to strike right at the base of all of their misery" (Malcolm [1964] 1992c: 114). Although Malcolm "misread" SNCC's organizing efforts in Mississippi (the MFDP was not an all black party, and remained an integrated geographically defined political project after SNCC declined), Malcolm used discourses of black authenticity to argue that SNCC was creating independent black power centers that did not have to submit to the white controlled Democratic Party. He identified their efforts to register black voters in relation to an independent black party because it was the first step in obtaining political power. Because a black only political party did not have to negotiate with white intraorganizational leaders, they would represent 'real' black interests and take care of black problems. Another authentically black civic practice supported by Malcolm was the idea of black capitalism.60 Black capitalism was a strategy that limited black mass consumption to black only businesses. The idea was that blacks could obtain economic power, thus creating black independence and power, because it "will eliminate the necessity of you and me having to act ignorantly and disgracefully boycotting and picketing some cracker someplace else trying to beg him for a job" (Malcolm [1964] 1968: 208).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Thus, Malcolm used discourses of black authenticity to articulate a set of ethical practices blacks should exhibit in order to distinguish a black identity that resisted black stereotypes, deracializing strategies, American nationhood and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Although I do not discuss the black capitalist project here, it was a contested project which drew support from some members of the rights project, such as Jesse Jackson and SCLC's Operation Breadbasket and black nationalists like CORE leader Floyd McKissick, it was also sharply criticized by more socialist inspired black nationalist groups, who referred to black capitalist supporters as "black pimps" (see SAV 48-7 "Total Control as the Only Solution to the Economic Problems of Black People")
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
207
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
white domination. We can see how the set of authentic black ethical practices
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
produced a new representation of the black political agent in how Malcolm
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
'remixed' Alain Locke's (1925) idea of the Harlem Renaissance's "New Negro" to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
distinguish the normative idea of the authentically black political agent claims of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
what counted authentic black practice.  Malcolm associated the "old Negro" with
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
blacks who could not abstain from bodily practices indicating whiteness, and who
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
were not prepared for revolutionary and separatist practices.  Malcolm portrayed
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the rights project's good black citizen as a modern day house slave, who enjoyed
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
a better standard of living in relation to black slaves who picked crops and dug
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
ditches,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
You have the modern counterpart of that slavery-time Uncle Tom... He doesn't wear a handkerchief around his head, sir. He wears a top hat. He speaks with a Harvard accent or a Howard accent... That negro runs around talking about how rich we are, how enlightened we are, how educated we are, or this is the free world or this is a free county, and at the same time he is begging the white man for civil rights and integration and all that kind of stuff he doesn't have (Malcolm [1963] 1971c: 89-90).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In contrast to the black nationalist project of producing an authentic black self by
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
recovering and preserving powerful black history, the rights political project is
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
associated with preserving an idealized American  nationhood.    The black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
nationalist project approached American nationhood as a product of black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
'repression', and to appeal to idealized American citizenship equated to rejecting
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black culture.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Malcolm used discourses of black authenticity to construct an idealized
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black political agent, a "New Negro", who rejected American nationhood because
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
historically, "He was the one that felt the brunt of the masters whip - and he
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
208
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
hated his master. If his master got sick, he didn't say, "Are we sick?" He prayed that his master would die" (Malcolm [1963] 1971c: 88). Malcolm's idea of the authentic black subject was made in relation to urban blacks, who suffered from lack of available jobs and were forced to live in public housing projects riddled with social vice. Civil rights leaders who are seeking integration for an elite segment of the black population excluded the northern urban blacks. Because authentic blacks are confined to the margin of society by whites and the rights political project, their only hope for recourse is situating their struggle outside of American cultural ideals of good citizenship. 'Real' black men, "He sees the entire world. And when he sees the world he sees that the majority of people on this earth are dark people and these dark people outnumber the whites" (Malcolm [1963] 1971c: 92). In part, Malcolm drew boundaries between the rights project an the black nationalist project based on identifying with an idealized nation-based civic identity versus an idealized black only identity, that crossed nation-state borders. THE BLACK NATIONALIST POLITICAL PROJECT AND SNCC
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SNCC drew primarily from Malcolm's elaborations of the black nationalist project. In part, this was due some encounters with Malcolm, coupled with Malcolm's expanding influence and popularity in black political cultures. Before his death, Malcolm briefly interacted with current and future SNCC members. Student activists that were part of the Nonviolent Action Group (NAG), including Carmichael, sponsored a debate between Malcolm and Bayard Rustin in 1962. In 1964, John Lewis had a chance encounter with Malcolm in Nairobi, Kenya,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
209
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
which led to SNCC bringing Malcolm to Selma, Alabama to speak at a 1965 voting rights rally61. Although the Nation of Islam persisted after Malcolm left the organization, and his subsequent death, their rigid system of bodily restraints did not appeal to all blacks. Subsequent black nationalist projects drew primarily form the ideas of abstaining from bodily mutilation, the appeal of racial separation, and Malcolm's idea of violent civic practices (operational, figurative) and alternative strategies for mobilizing black communities (black capitalism, independent black political parties).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Although SNCC slowly began to incorporate discourses of black authenticity into their mobilization strategies, the publication of The Autobiography of Malcolm X in 1965 represented a sharp change in the debate on how to proceed for racial equality. For example, a white civil rights activist Jack Minnis published a periodical titled "Life with Lyndon in the Great Society" as a critique of 1960s liberalism.62 The periodical was published between 1965-196663. Next to Bob Zellner, Minnis was arguable the most influential white member in SNCC, who helped oust John Lewis as chairman in favor of Carmichael, and remained part of SNCC's central committee and internal education program until the fall 1966 (Carson 1995: 236). Before the publication of Malcolm's autobiography, the periodical reported on issues pertaining to the relations between civil rights struggles and southern governments, and the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
61   No transcripts exist on what Malcolm said to SNCC or any of Malcolm encounters and meetings with African leaders. For reference, see Carson 1994: 135-136
&lt;/p&gt;

63  No information is available for the number of issues printed, but it was a weekly publication, and part of SNCC's central committee's internal education program that would have been sent to all active political cells.
&lt;/p&gt;

expanding southern military-industrial economy. This included topics on the local white supremacist groups' influence over local geopolitical legislature, the Southern State Industrial Council (SSCI) lobbying efforts and connection to northern industry, and corporations like General Electric that were manufacturing and supplying weapons in Vietnam. Starting in the November 1965 issue (Volume 1 #41), the tone and focus of the periodical changed from Selma and Vietnam to power. Minnis urged, "All civil rights workers and all black Americans who are interested in what we call 'freedom' should read this book... One of the reasons the book is important, is that when Malcolm X spoke, he leveled right down on his point, and he talked in the language of the people of the streets of the ghetto."64 As the students became aware of the black nationalist project, they distanced themselves from the logistics and networks of the power elite, to ideas that they needed to concentrate on 'real' black issues. The rights project spent considerable effort developing black civic vocabulary to debate civic topics such the workings of a local power structure. However, the black nationalist project proposed a competing political vocabulary that changed how SNCC mobilized southern blacks. Despite members of SNCC never mastering or adopting many of the Nation of Islam's authentic black practices, Malcolm X represented an idealized revolutionary black political agent to emulate. Next, I will compare how SNCC used discourses of black authenticity to change their approach to question of the racialized self, the question of whites in the movement, and the question of violence.

              &lt;p&gt;
The Question of the Racial Self
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SNCC began to use discourses of black authenticity to define techniques of authentic black self. Until 1965, SNCC used discourses of good black citizenship to organize a set of personal ethical practices that allowed SNCC members to access and navigate through unfamiliar rural black communities. As noted in chapter 3, SNCC outlined how to practice good manners by defining how members should initiate contact with local blacks, the subject matter of discussions, and how to take second readings of what the local residents said. In addition to bonding with families and networking with potential allies, mastering techniques of good black self to limit black stereotypes was important to the activists overall safety. SNCC handed out security handbooks detailing personal practices to exhibit and to avoid. The security book indicated that SNCC volunteers should, "Try to avoid bizarre or provocative clothing or beards, be neat". When traveling through the community, volunteers should "Remove all unnecessary objects from your car which could be constituted as weapons (hammers, files, iron rulers, etc.) Absolutely no liquor bottles, beer cans etc. should be inside your car. Do not travel with names and addresses of local contacts" (RS 1-3). As a SNCC activist working in the 'field', it was important to not to appear racially threatening because it could save your life. SNCC activist had to navigate both black stereotypes and juridical-prohibitions that policed black stereotypes. It was important not to be in possession of any object that whites could define as a weapon. In addition to debunking black stereotypes, drinking alcohol or smoking marijuana violated Mississippi prohibition laws, which
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
212
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
gave police a reason to raid SNCC offices and freedom houses. In 1962 SNCC activists Bob Zellner, Dion Diamond and Charles McDrew were arrested on charges of criminal anarchy in Baton Rouge, Louisiana for possessing protest literature - a charge that carried a sentence of the death penalty (see Carson 1995: 53).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In part, SNCC's grassroots project was already practicing the idea of building independent black communities. Along with decline of SNCC members who associated nonviolence with Christian ideals, and the increase of secular activists not wedded to the ideas of nonviolence as Christian doctrine, SNCC focus on organizing practices based on a shared local geopolitical culture opened opportunities to use alternative discourses. SNCC's adoption of the black nationalist project was due to both the 1) geopolitical nature of organizing the rural south and 2) the shift in membership that was more open to using alternative discourses to organize and sustain the grassroots project. SNCC activists faced more intense forms of violence and experienced less change from the Civil Rights Act than SCLC's national efforts. Thus, SNCC became part of the black nationalist project once they began using discourses of black authenticity to reinterpret the question of using of violence, the question of working with whites, and why they were mobilizing black communities. Although the rights project idea of good black citizenship continued to dominate public discourse, the newer SNCC members had little history using discourses of good black citizenship, and the practice of organizing local black communities to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
213
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
provide real and symbolic distance from the other parts of SNCC that still drew from the idea of producing good black citizens.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SNCC began rejecting the idea that mastering techniques of good black self provided the right way to approach racial equality. They questioned whether it provided southern blacks and SNCC activists security from violent whites. SNCC began using discourses of black authenticity to argue that blacks needed to exhibit personal ethical practices associated with an authentic black subject. In their 1966 pamphlet titled "The Story of SNCC", SNCC argued that "in the schoolroom and in all aspects of daily life, black people are denied access to their own culture; they are taught that white is right, white is beautiful. A reawakening of cultural identity - the rebirth of what might be called psychological equality - is essential" (RS 1-10). It was not the case that a black identity needed reawakening. SNCC used discourse of black authenticity to create a black political agent they claimed to represent. SNCC members, who never dressed conservatively anyway, began to grow out their natural hair, sideburns and, indeed, began to project the very personal appearance they previously saw as too dangerous. One SNCC member Bill Ware wore traditional African garb and grew a beard to signify his identification with pan-Africanism (see Carson 1995: 193).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
We can see how SNCC changed their pedagogy once they adopted the black nationalist political project. Despite never organizing an equivalent to freedom summer, SNCC published new materials for black children and engagement calendars for black adults.   In 1965, SNCC published a 51 page
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
214
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
booklet Negroes in American History: A Freedom Primer developed by Bobbi Cieciorka and Frank Cieciorka. Unlike good citizenship pedagogy, where students developed civic vocabularies and learned the history and ideas of the movement by practicing their handwriting and constructing sentences and narratives, Negroes in American History supplied a history of black struggles and practiced coloring pictures. Rather than represent an idealized history of the current civil rights struggles, the booklet sought to represent an idealized history of black resistance. The Cieciorka's noted the book was a "history about us" and as black students read the book, "ask why haven't I learned about Cherokee Bill, Nat Turner, Pete Sulam, Sojourner Truth and many others in this book who fought against being slaves, and fought for freedom in this country and weren't happy and satisfied". The Cieciorka's had asked this rhetorical question in response to general public education and the civil rights citizenship schools. Regarding the former, public schools did not teach black history, nor did they refer to the presence of blacks in history. As for the citizenship schools, they concentrated on the history of the civil rights movement under King's leadership and the importance of nonviolent civic practice. As noted in chapter 3, the citizenship schools discussed Gandhi and India, and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, not slave revolts or African anti-colonialism.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
215
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Second, the Cieciorka's replaced handwriting with coloring . Rather than organize a set of techniques to master by practicing good speaking and listening skills, then writing the words and constructing sentences on why good manners were important for the civil rights movement, Negroes in American History featured pictures for the students to color (see Appendix 1). The idea behind coloring the pictures was to learn a different set of racial practices associated with black resistance. For example, Images 1 and 2 represent black anti-slavery resistance. Image 1 represented a heroic and hypermasculine black man, posed like a comic book superhero. He stands tall, somewhat muscular, with his shoulders back, his eyebrows slightly frowned, and nostrils slightly flared, which signified a look of conviction. The man is holding a flaming torch, and the flames trace back to a large, four pillared house in the style of a southern plantation owner's house. Image 2 represented a child, with grown in 'afro', reading in the bushes out of sight from surveillance of the slave master. The child looks stoic, eyes fixated on the book with slight smile over his face. One the one hand, these images challenged southern revisionist historians claim that slavery was not as bad as some thought, and that many blacks preferred the stability and routine of slave life to freedom66. On the other hand, these images demonstrated the idea that blacks resisted by not being the good citizen. The images provided alternatives   to   the   conservatively   dressed   and   racially   non-threatening
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
65 Similarly, Julis Lester has continued to publish children's books with African themes and black characters. Although the children books do not represent a black nationalist project, and since the civil rights movement Lester has noted that his black nationalism was not very sincere, they nevertheless represent the black nationalist project legacy amongst academics and pedagogy. See Lester 1976 on how he notes the paradox in hi writing a book on black power, but never fully embracing the idea.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
66 For example of the southern revisionist perspective that downplayed the brutality of slavery and its impact on black Americans, see Lingley and Foley 1935, and Coulter 1950.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
216
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
techniques of good black self. Authentic blacks looked menacing and threatening to project a powerful image. They were sly, cunning, and sought knowledge about 'blackness' rather than idealized American nationhood.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Images 3 through 5 dealt with the subject of contemporary rural black southern culture. Three images represent three distinct southern subjects - the black farmer, the white southern sheriff, and violence inflicted upon civil rights protesters. Image 3 is the black farmer plowing his fields. For SNCC's grassroots and black nationalist project, the rural black farmer represented their idea of the authentic black. He was the subject that needed to rise up and become a leader He is pushing the plow with his left hand and carrying a single shot rifle with his right. He is looking over his shoulder, were the farmers eyes direct us to his 'shack' - a log cabin without any windows or a door. The image creates the idea that he is looking over his shoulder, or 'watching his back', for bad whites, such as an arsonist or bomber. Image 4 represented a southern sheriff holding a gun in his left hand while he leans on a box marked 'ballot box'. The sheriffs piercing eyes and look of indifference signified how whites did not care if blacks won the right to vote. Image 5 represented a police officer, in either riot gear or state police uniform, hitting the protesters. The protesters were 'covering up' just as SNCC had instructed. One protester had his arms folded over his head to protect his ears and back of his head. The other protester is crouched over, using his back to absorb the blows. The common theme of violence binds images 3 through 5. The rural black farmer survived in a violent southern culture by carrying arms.    The southern sheriff used violence to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
217
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
reproduce an idea of white power. The police attacked and beat nonviolence protesters attempting to do create social change the 'right way'. The idea was that blacks had to first live and struggle for racial equality in the 'real' world, a world organized by violence and racial differences, before they could entertain ideas of a deracialized good polity.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SNCC also began publishing engagement calendars. The engagement calendars appeared after SNCC ceased publication of the Student Voice in 1967 (CC 2-18). Rather than tell the story of Montgomery, Birmingham or Selma, the 1967 engagement calendars presented images of who counted as an authentic black subject. The 1967 calendar included pictures of Malcolm X and images of southern black poverty - dirt roads, a black man literally holding his pot to piss in, and malnourished black children. The 1968 calendar included pictures of a black women with an 'afro' kissing a black baby, an anti-war demonstration, more pictures of southern poverty, urban poverty (black girl playing with white dolls on the front stoop) and coca-cola sign that read "Selma, Al. Progressive and Friendly". The images sought to define authentic blacks and authentic southern poverty. Malcolm X, and black women without processed hair, represented blacks who practiced authentic black personal ethics. Dirt roads, no plumbing, and little black girls learning to hate being black signified 'real' relations between blacks and whites.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In sum, SNCC used discourses of black authenticity to tell a black nationalist story of black resistance rather than idealized American story of the black civil rights movement.   They sought to shape black ethical practices that
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
218
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
distinguished blacks from both black stereotypes and idealized good citizenship. Real blacks emphasized bodily techniques that whites found scary and intimidating. The idea was that stereotypical depictions of blacks as irrational and prone to violence could be used to blacks advantage. Despite using discourses of black authenticity to shape a black nationalist identity amongst many SNCC members, SNCC could not systematically organize any effective ways to mobilize southern blacks into ethical black nationalist subjects (see Chapter 5). The Question of Whites and Racial Purity in SNCC
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The second major question SNCC faced was the question of how they should approach working with whites and the number of whites in the organization. The white question was not new by the time SNCC adopted the black nationalist project. Indeed, SNCC consistently struggled with questions of the ratio of whites to blacks, how to use white skills for mobilization, and sexual tensions between black men and white women. SNCC began as an interracial group fighting for black equality. They drew their pool of volunteers from students, both white and black, who worked intimately with one another on their respected programs. This was different from the virtually all black run NAACP and SCLC. Therefore, more opportunities existed in SNCC for both interracial tensions and possibilities. SNCC had used discourses of good black citizenship to deracialize the black/white tensions and organize interracial ethical practices. For example, an early-1963 memo from Julian Bond represented how he was
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
219
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
concerned about the ratio of whites to blacks.  However, Bond did not argue for
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
fewer whites. Rather, he was concerned with not having enough good blacks:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
We are attracting large numbers of northern and western whites, but do not seem to gather sizeable numbers of young Negroes... I emphasize college age, because I think we have a need for people with skills we commonly associate with young persons in college. By skills I mean typing, writing ability, speaking ability, organizing ability and thinking ability (EB 6-3)
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The Bond text indicated that SNCC needed more black volunteers with good
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
writing and good speaking ability who could represent the organizations as good
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black citizens.   The quantity of black volunteers was not as important as the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
quality. In 1963, SNCC still held on to ideas that it was important for rural blacks
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
to get used to whites, and vice versa, for interracial practices and political
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
coalitions to work. Furthermore, Bond associated the question of whites with the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
need for good manners and increased discipline in the movement, "All of SNCC
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
needs to return - if we have slipped away - to a more serious consideration of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
what we are about.   We need to think more courteously of each other, others
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
outside SNCC and those who work with" (EB 6-3).    For Bond, SNCC could
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
overcome the difficulties and cultural differences by emphasizing good mannered
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
social ethical practices.    Bond's memo indicates that SNCC sought to settle
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
questions and debates within SNCC by placing the responsibility on SNCC
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
volunteers to master interracial social ethical practices.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Despite SNCC leaders, like Bond, emphasizing good manners and being
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
cordial when practicing interracial social ethical practices, the white question
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
persisted.  By 1964, SNCC members compiled a list of problems stemming from
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
white-black interactions.   Notes gathered from a SNCC meeting, labeled "Some
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
220
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Aspects of Black-White problems as seen by field staff", indicated the following problems: 1) the "fears that Negroes have of being associated with an interracial group in Mississippi", 2) black "insecurities [to] whites superior education", 3) the "past racial incidents that are still bugging people, not solved by talking", 4) that blacks grew "up hating whites", 5) the question of not wanting "whites visible in places where people have not learned to trust Negro leadership", 6) the "obsession of Negroes with whites", and 7) the "sexual problems that racism produces" (CC 1-1). SNCC was finding it increasingly difficult to overcome cultural differences that were both racial and geographical. Many whites involved with SNCC did not realize they contributed to the problems they wanted to solve. In Mississippi, whites lynched, beat or killed blacks if they publicly associated with whites, especially black men and white women. Whites took for granted that their increased levels of education and prior leadership positions were not equally available to blacks. Southern blacks did not trust whites and would often tell whites what they wanted to hear to make them go away. 'Sexual problems that racism produces' referred to tensions between white and black females over black males approaching white females, and white females feeling that if they did not accept the advances of black males then they would appear racist. At this time, SNCC was still trying to solve interracial problems in discourse of good black citizenship. There was an idea that if whites could become more familiar and achieve a better understanding of southern black culture, the tensions between whites and blacks would decrease.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
221
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Thus, the white question was an ongoing problem.    Since SNCC's
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
grassroots    project    deemphasized    formal    leadership,    they    placed    the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
responsibility to work out existing black-white problems on individual members.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
What changed in SNCC is that a new group of leaders began using discourses of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black authenticity to interpret the problem of whites as the physical presence of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
whites, and the solution that blacks could no longer work with whites.67   For
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
instance, by 1965 even seasoned SNCC activists, like John Lewis, who did not
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
support the black nationalist project began looking for new solutions,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Is it possible for negroes and whites in this country to engage in a certain political experiment such as the world has never yet witnessed and in which the first condition would be that whites consented to let negroes run their own revolution, giving them the necessary support, and being alarmed at some of the sacrifices and difficulties this would involve? ... Much as it may anger some die hard white, the fact that a negro sits down next to a white woman at a lunch counter and orders a coke and hamburger is still short of revolution (CC 2-18).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
According to Lewis, the physical presence of whites was the problem.   Racial
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
differences precluded whites from understanding what blacks 'really wanted'.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Whites believed integration counted as progress, while blacks wanted respect
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and political power. Thus, some SNCC members began using discourse of black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
authenticity to argue for the merits of racial exclusion without ever embracing a
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black nationalist project.  Therefore, discourses of black authenticity shaped the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
changes SNCC made in organization to eventually become a black nationalist
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
group.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Carson noted that the activists involved in forming SNCC as a nonviolent and religious organization were gone by 1965, and replaced by secular members not committed to ideals of nonviolence and the importance of interracial cooperation (1995:192)
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
222
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In 1966, SNCC held a meeting where members could outline their position
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
on working with whites.    Carson noted that initially the majority of the 100
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
attendees rejected dismissing whites, but black nationalist members swayed
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
them through debate to agree to expel whites (Carson 1995: 240).    For our
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
purposes here, the debate represented how discourses of black authenticity
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
shaped the white question.   At the meeting, the black nationalist faction of the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SNCC argued that SNCC had to remove whites from the group if blacks ever
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
wanted to achieve power. In a position paper, Bill Ware argued that whites,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
they can participate on an intellectual level. They cannot participate on an emotional level... By this I mean they can not participate where arms are necessary. They cannot participate where violence is necessary. They cannot participate where anger is necessary. They cannot participate where revenge is necessary. They can not participate where hate is necessary.68
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
We can see here how Ware used the idea of black authenticity to contrast the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black revolutionary agent with whites.   Whites lacked the necessary affective
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
responses indicative to a revolutionary black subject.   Because whites did not
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
endure racial discrimination, they were not angry enough to engage in revolution.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Nor were they capable of practicing violence or revenge on other whites.   Only
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the authentic black revolutionary subject embodied the hate and anger necessary
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
to exhibit violent practices.   This differed from how SNCC used discourses of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
good black citizen to argue that it was necessary for white involvement because
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
blacks and whites had to learn to work together and trust one another as a
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
condition for racial equality. At the close of the meeting, SNCC officially voted to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
expel all whites from the organization.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
223
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
We can see how SNCC began using discourses of black authenticity to shape how they approached the struggle for civil rights. First, they stopped attaching the black self to American nationhood in favor of attaching the black self to the black racial group. Second, they increasingly defined the black movement as a "nomadic" struggle instead of a domestic struggle. Three, there was new focus on how to deal with blacks not considered 'black enough'. Finally, there shift in how they problemized the role of black women.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
First, SNCC switched their mobilizing strategies from voter registration to organizing black only political parties to obtain power and govern black communities. In their pamphlet titled "What is Black Power and Why Do We Need It", SNCC used the idea that it was better for blacks to govern blacks: "They aim to take power at the local level first: to put a black man in the sheriff's uniform, make a black man tax assessor so he can see that taxes are collected to build better roads, schools, homes for black people" (RF 1-1). The idea of obtaining power shifted how SNCC mobilized blacks around ideas of integrating into the existing power structure to organizing black communities to challenge the legitimacy and authority of the existing power structure. When SNCC mobilized the MFDP, it did so around the idea of 'empowering' local impoverished Mississippians despite ones race. They organized the group by geopolitical and spatial-cultural location. The MFDP did not exclude whites. It was predominantly black, only four whites made the trip as delegates to Atlantic City, because whites refused or feared joining due to reprimands from other whites. MFDP was nonviolent and sought social change by challenging Mississippi's mainstream
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
224
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Democratic Party to allow blacks into the party and renounce their opposition to desegregation. In contrast, Carmichael organized Lowndes County, Mississippi, after the 1965 voting act around the idea of an all-black independent party (see Chapter 5). Carmichael helped form the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO) in relation to the question of how blacks should organize without formal barriers, like literacy tests, taking up the majority of field workers time. The LCFO excluded whites from joining the organization because they wanted to build an independent all-black political party to challenge southern Democratic parties. They rejected nonviolent practices because of the local geopolitical context of rural Mississippi - specifically white violence. SNCC and the LCFO used the black panther as a symbol of their authentic blackness, and began posting armed guards at their meetings.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Second, SNCC began to portray American blacks as nomads who lacked a nation and civic belonging. The idea of being a nomadic meant that American blacks did not have a home, or nation, and therefore should not feel constrained by idealized American nationhood. Their juridical status as American citizens was a temporary status. Lacking geopolitical and territorial belonging, nomads organized racially in relation to similar global racial groups. The idea of blacks as nomads organized the migration back to Africa argument, which has been foundational idea in black nationalist thought since Delany and Garvey. SNCC drew from the nomadic idea, especially after visits to Africa, to argue that blacks could seek inclusion with Africa if the American struggles fail. In 1967, various SNCC members visited Africa.    Carmichael met with African Algerian and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
225
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Guinean leaders and questioned why blacks were not migrating back to Africa (Carson 1995: 276-277). James Forman circulated to SNCC members a letter regarding the back to Africa question, suggesting, "We should return to Africa. We should use our skills where they are wanted."69 The back to Africa question represented how SNCC sought to attach SNCC with world struggles. Lacking geopolitical belonging, they used discourses of black authenticity to divide the world into struggles between racial groups. Drawing from Malcolm, SNCC argued blacks should model themselves after global racial groups. On the one hand, this included greater discussion of Native American and pan-African post-colonial struggles (see Carmichael [1967] 1969: 115). On the other hand, discussions between SNCC and the Oakland based Black Panther Party sought a relationship modeled after 'successful' communist groups. SNCC wanted the Panthers to serve as the military wing, and SNCC as the political wing, modeled after the Chinese revolution. The Panthers wanted to have a combined military and political operation, modeled after the Cuban revolution (see Lester 1976: 234).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Third, SNCC shifted their critique from the white racists to intra-group distinctions. SNCC began using discourses of black authenticity to paradoxically define what counted as techniques of an authentically black self and to criticize the how blacks continued to police and erect boundaries around the idea of who are real blacks. Racial exclusions within SNCC included whites as well as blacks associated with whiteness. They were especially concerned with the blacks associated with the 'Uncle Tom' and sought to control the black revolution for the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
69 RY Box 1 Folder "SNCC and Lyndon and the Great Society"
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
226
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
benefits of whites. "White racists and uncle Tom's they create always try to divide us... we have to unite around the idea of independent political forces, independent economic forces" (RF 1-1). SNCC excluded blacks who did not conform to their idea of an authentic black political agent, including making intra-group distinctions on light versus dark skinned blacks. Carmichael gave a speech at Morgan State, an all black college in 1967, in which he criticized how southern blacks mimicked whites. He used discourses of black authenticity to argue that blacks should not hold debutante balls or organize fraternities and sororities. He noted that black fraternities were divided between light and dark skinned blacks: "So what did our brothers do - they turned around and formed something called Kappas, and only light skinned Negroes could get in...So the other dark skinned brothers, not to be outdone, set up Omega and Alpha" (Carmichael [1967] 1969: 111-112). Carmichael's text represented how the idea of bodily skin tone, rather than around just being black, hierarchically organized black fraternities, and was use of light skin to distinguish black elites. In 1967, the Student Voice published an 11-page booklet, titled "Black Body White Mind" that chastised the practices of black colleges, especially Howard, which "required you to submit a picture of yourself before you were admitted. Of course, the pictures established your color credentials. If white all right, if black get back; along with the 'palm test' - the palm of your hand had to come damn close to the color of your face in order for you to get in" (SAV 46). The text related the idea of privileging "light skinned" blacks to Howard's freshman orientation, which warned the black men "of the dangers of the surrounding community of northwest
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
227
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Washington", the dangers of "block boys", and to avoid "parties in the black community". The message Howard sent, they argued, was "how to defend yourself from that savage, wild, uncivilized community."
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Finally, how SNCC viewed black women changed. As noted in chapter three, black women resisted attempts to minimize their contributions and relegate them to secretarial duties. SNCC drew from how the Nation of Islam attached organized gendered relations. Black femininity was associated as inferior to black masculinity because they were prone to give in to passion or adopt 'immoral' ethical practices in order to gain social status. The Nation of Islam separated black women from all sexual and social relations with white men. Concerning white men, the Nation of Islam argued, "no white man has honorable intentions toward any black women" (quoted in Lincoln 1961: 172-173). Because of the history of rape in the slave system, and white men's failure to acknowledge their interracial offspring, white men were classified as 'sexual deviants'. White women also posed a threat to the purity of black women. The Nation of Islam argued that black women copied white women by "displaying their bodies, neglecting their children and abandoning their men" (quoted in Lincoln 1961: 172-173). Black women only achieved self-worth and an authentic black identity by remaining in the house. In their "Muslim Girl Training Classes", the Nation of Islam taught all Muslim women domestic practices of how to cook, manage the house and children, as well as good hygiene and medial practices, in order to accent their femininity.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
228
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Carmichael drew from these associations of black femininity, and placed the responsibility on black women to reject techniques of bodily mutilation and reject careers in social work. He suggested that if black women wanted to start being authentic black women, then they should stop being "...ashamed of your hair and you don't cut it to the scalp so that naps won't show?" Black women have to stop using Nadinola cream and mimicking the aesthetic practices of white women because black college campuses "are becoming infested with wigs and Mustangs and you are to blame for it" (Carmichael [1967] 1969: 121). In order for black women to master authentic black techniques of self, they should limit all practices that mutilated the body, in order to represent an idea of whiteness. Secondly, authentic black women did not become representatives of state administrative power. Specifically, black women should no longer seek to become teachers in segregated schools, and most importantly, should stop becoming social workers. Carmichael argued that going to college to become a social worker helps the state 'repress' poor blacks in exchange for the benefit of a few blacks. He asked if the reason why black women went to college was, "So that you can keep the kid in the ghetto school, so that you can ride up in a big Bonneville with [an] AKA sign stuck on the back?" (Carmichael [1967] 1969: 121).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In part, the critique of the black social worker represented the black nationalist rejection of how social workers have 'destroyed' black communities by breaking up black families. However, it also represented a critique of how black women had been 'closer' to whites than black men had, in their jobs as
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
229
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
domestics. The same practices of a domestic - maid, nanny - applied to the social worker: mastering techniques of a nurturing self to keep the white family (the state) healthy at the expense of the health of their own black family (black ghettos). However, Carmichael also contrasted real black women to black women who learned from their mothers to "Be sure to pick a nice-looking fellow with curly hair when you get married dear." Or if your lips are too thick, bite them in. Hold you nose; don't drink coffee because you are black" (Carmichael [1967] 1969: 121). SNCC formed boundaries between blacks based on limiting aesthetic practices associated with southern, 'waspy' whites in favor of mastering ethical practices associated with black authenticity. Authentic black women were concerned with the well-being of the black family and black community before whites and American nationhood.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In sum, the question of how to mobilize with whites preceded SNCC's adoption of the black nationalist political project. SNCC used of discourses of black authenticity to argue that racial differences were irreducible, and future racial struggles should be racially homogenous. The expulsion of whites accompanied an increased focus on intragroup, the good black/bad black binary, ethical practices. SNCC attempted to racially purify the black struggle by mobilizing around the idea of obtaining power rather than civic inclusion, using the idea of blacks as nomads rather than American citizens, and marginalizing blacks who did not conform to their idealized image of blackness. The Question of Violence
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
230
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The last major question SNCC faced was what counted as authentic black civic ethical practices. The question of using violence meant using self-defense, but also flirted with the idea of violent revolutionary practices. SNCC usually posed the question of whether or not they should permit self-defense civic practices. However, the question of violence included how to use emotions in protest, what counted as acceptable forms of individual resistance, and the relationship between violence and strategies to secure control over black communities. SNCC's rejection of nonviolence did not mean a switch to violent revolutionary practices. What the rejection of nonviolence did was create openings for additional techniques of resistance and altered what blacks in the movement considered acceptable ethical civic practices, which subsequently shaped an idea of the revolutionary black political agent.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
As others have noted, SNCC's rejection of nonviolence in favor of self-defense reflected, in part, the violence context of organizing in the American south (Zinn 1965, Carson 1995). Rural southern black resistance had a history of blacks attempting to organize around idea of armed resistance. In 1957, Robert Williams rebuilt a fledgling NAACP chapter in Monroe, North Carolina around the idea of armed self-defense. He recruited black laborers, farmers, domestic workers and returning WW2 veterans to replace the black professionals who feared reprisals from the white community if caught as a member of the NAACP (Williams [1962] 1968). Part of Williams claims that blacks should use violence to defend their homes and families was that part of being black was to be emotional and be violent, "We know that the average Afro-American is not a
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
231
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
pacifist. He's not a pacifist and he has never been a pacifist and he's not made of the type of material that would make a good pacifist" (Williams. [1962] 1968: 197). Williams wrapped self-defense practices around the idea that it is not possible for authentic blacks to be nonviolent. Most likely drawing on images of the African warrior, he portrayed 'nature' as programming blacks as a violent people. Therefore, he created the idea that violent and self-defense practices are a better fit for black protest.70
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Part of SNCC's adoption of violent practices was how they associated the 'black farmer' as the idealized authentic black subject. In part, discourses of Jacksonian democracy have idealized "the farmer" as the rugged, independent, survivor who is the moral superior to cosmopolitan urban citizens. Situated in discourses of black authenticity, SNCC used the distinction that the black farmers geographical and symbolic distance from urban blacks as and all whites as represented an idealized black culture. The paradox of SNCC's idealizing southern black culture of delta Mississippi blues music, southern 'soul food71' diet, and agricultural labor, was that it represented the antithesis of the Nation of Islam's authentic black subject. Nevertheless, SNCC workers emulated black farmers. SNCC workers dressed in blue jean overalls, what farmers wore in the fields, to signify their identification with rural black culture. Since black farmers armed themselves and carried guns in the field, to protect their crops, family and SNCC workers living at their houses, SNCC field workers adopted the same practice of carrying guns for self-defense.   Indeed, in 1964 Carmichael argued

232
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
that it was not ethical to tell farmers to stop carrying weapons to protect themselves, noting that SCLC does not mobilize in the same areas or work with the same people that SNCC does (Carson 1995: 164). Therefore, the practice of carrying guns made SNCC workers more authentically black and legit when mobilizing in rural Mississippi and Alabama.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Drawing from the competing and idealized violent southern black cultures, SNCC urged blacks to master two civic practices as an alternative to nonviolent practices. The first practice was the idea of using figurative violence. Specifically, blacks had to master the art of a hyperracialized black subject to intimidate and frighten whites into making political concessions. It was important to let whites know that blacks were willing to use violence if necessary, to stop white violence directed at blacks. This was the idea behind using the image of the black panther to represent "the newly aggressive and courageous spirit of Negro demands it stands for black power" (RS 1-10). However, it was more efficient to stop white violence if blacks appeared more menacing. This included growing out the hair, getting bigger muscles and not dressing conservatively. It included a using more slang and 'broken English' - such 'ain't', like Julius Lester's book titled Look Out Whitey! Black Power Gon' Get Your Moma. It also meant using hate and anger to their advantage. They viewed southern whites as preferring to deal with nonviolent blacks because there was no chance of the whites getting hit or hurt. That is, good black citizens did not frighten whites, but hyperracialized black men did. Whites feared many of the stereotypes they created - such as the violent, oversexualized, and out of control black male.  For
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
233
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SNCC, the use of figurative violence as a personal and civic ethical practice was a strategy to obtain power through violence and intimidation, notably used in their work in Lowndes County, Mississippi and in the 'Vine City' neighborhood in Atlanta (see Chapter 5).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In contrast to the rights project's instruction that black activists exhibit good civic practices at all times - including when being tear gassed and imprisoned - SNCC used discourses of black authenticity to suggest practicing individual forms of resistance, such as 'sabotage'. Sabotage was a practice used by those confined to the margins of society. For example, the engagement calendars SNCC produced told the story of how blacks undertook individual forms of resistance when whites were not looking, "Our resistance struggle has taken many forms. During slavery it took the form of song and story and the ingratiating smile which disturbed the tranquility of many a white man. It also took the form of spiders in the soup, broken farm tools, accidental-on-purpose fires and murder."72 SNCC argued that sabotage practices disrupted the 'normal' workings of 'white society' that confined blacks to the margins. The idea was that the history of authentic black protest was resisting whenever and however blacks could. When in the presence of whites, black resistance was limited to nonviolent mass protest. However, when not in the presence of whites blacks could sabotage food, machines, neighborhoods in place of boycotts and marches. Because the acts of sabotage are intimate and personal, requiring working from the inside, sabotage was a practice reserved for blacks' who could work with whites without minimizing emotional hatred toward them.

CONCLUSION
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The idea behind an authentic black self was to produce a racialized black body attached to a culturally pure and idealized racial group. This contrasted to how the rights political project shaped an ethical black political agent attached to an idealized American nationhood. We can isolate two sets of ethical practices that represented an authentic black self. The black nationalist project defined and ranked authentic black practices in relation how they associated personal, social and civic ethical practices with whites. The first techniques of authentic black self were the ethical bodily ethics of mastering bodily pleasures, appearance, and postures. Mastering techniques of authentic black self meant mastering a set of dietary practices that abstained from southern cuisine, which included pork, which distinguished blacks from their enslaved and segregated past. The black nationalist project associated consuming a southern idea with accepting and reproducing a marginalized past. Many of the southern foods that constituted a black soul food diet, including chitlins, catfish and corn bread, lack nutritional value, and were prepared from the leftover food not good enough for wealthy whites to eat. Authentic blacks were encouraged to eat more cow/beef, and lamb, cuisine associated with dietary practices of powerful groups, as well as Middle Eastern and African diets. Similarly, mastering techniques of authentic black self required refraining from bodily pleasures that jeopardized the productive black body. Blacks' who failed to refrain from social vice, including drugs, alcohol, produced an unproductive black subject associated with black stereotypes of not willing or wanting to work or take care of the family. Mastering
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
235
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
pleasures stabilized heteronormative black families, shielding blacks from police and social workers, who the black nationalist project isolated as responsible for destroying black communities. Blacks could obtain power and control their community only after they neutralized white governing practices associated with controlling the black populace. Thus, mastering dietary and consumption pleasures produced a more racially pure black subject capable of obtaining power and responsibly governing black communities.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to mastering bodily pleasures, the black nationalist project used discourses of black authenticity to define a set of practices aimed at preserving and producing an authentic black body. The idea of preserving the authentic black body meant refraining from bodily mutilation practices that straightened black hair or using cream to lighten and smooth out skin tone. The black body should be presented in its natural state. Preserving the black body also meant mastering pleasures associated with interracial sex. For black men, interracial sexual pleasures differed from intra-racial sexual pleasures because of 1) the cultural ideals of beauty attached to whiteness, and 2) the taboo of white women that made them off limits to blacks, made interracial sex more desirable, and provided a distinction for increased social standing among other black men. Mastering interracial sexual pleasures preserved the black body because it insured an all black genetic lineage. The absence of white genes makes the American black skin darker, whose appearance is more similar to that of an original African skin tone and bloodline. The idea behind mastering bodily postures meant producing a hypermasculine black male body and a feminine
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
236
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black female body. Black men were encouraged to practice bodybuilding and fighting. Women were encouraged to practice good housekeeping. The idea of mastering gender specific bodily postures was to discipline the body to produce an idealized black only community. Powerful black men governed the black public sphere while domesticated black women managed the private sphere. The gender divisions within the black community represented, in part, ideas of 'traditional' gender roles, but it also represented practices designed to maintain and reproduce black communities that were independent from whites and state surveillance.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The second set of authentic black ethical practices was rejecting nonviolence in favor of civic practices designed to obtain power. In part, the black nationalist project attached violence to an idea of authentic black civic practice by distinguishing operational from figurative violence. Operational violence was the practice of self-defense or violent revolution to obtain power, while figurative violence was the practice of exhibiting bodily postures and affective responses that represented and idealized black revolutionary agent to frighten whites into granting concessions. The actual practice of using violence was downplayed in favor of techniques of figurative violence that intimidated whites. Physical black intimidation sought to decrease white violence and scare whites into granting political rights. Situated in discourses of black authenticity, rejecting nonviolence also produced additional strategies of organizing independent black political cultures and civic practices of self-defense, sabotage, and revolutionary violence.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
237
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Thus, the idea of authentic black civic practices created independent black political cells to obtain power rather than civic inclusion.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Although the black nationalist and rights political projects shared similar ideas of good bodily postures, conservative dress, and gender differences, competing discourses organized these practices for different reasons. The black nationalist project used discourses of black authenticity to define personal ethical practices for the purposes of keeping whites away. If blacks were not engaging in any illegal practices, if they groomed the body and refrained from dressing the body in clothes associated with gangsters or pimps, then blacks would be free from the surveillance of white police and social workers. In contrast, the mainstream civil rights project defined a similar set of personal ethical practices to prepare blacks for desegregation and civic inclusion. The idea was that conservative styles of dress, good manners and postures represented a racially non-threatening black citizen capable of governing and participating in racially diverse and cosmopolitan communities. Both political projects accompanied an idea of black masculinity, however, the competing discourses shaped two different ideas of the good black man. For the mainstream civil rights project, discourses of good black citizenship constructed black men in relation to being equal to good white men. The ordering process was deracialized, but gendered - male first, then female. On the other hand, the black nationalist project used discourses of black authenticity to construct black men in relation black women. They used an ordering process was race first, and then gendered. The emphasis on black first opened up more possibilities for black women to occupy
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
238
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
positions of leadership in black communities, whereas the emphasis on male first confined black and white women to the margins of the movement.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Other differences between the competing projects were more explicit. The primary difference between the competing political projects was producing a self attached to an idealized American nationhood or producing a self attached with an idealized and exclusive racial group. The mainstream civil rights project used discourses of good black citizenship to produce a black political agent attached to an idealized American nationhood. This meant instructing and training blacks on personal, social and civil ethical practices that represented the idealized good black citizen. It downplayed the importance of racial identity in favor of producing an idea of good citizenship, and accompanying set of good civic practices, for blacks and whites to exhibit. In contrast, the black nationalist project rejected the idea of a good black citizen in favor of organizing the black community as a racial group first. The idea was that racial groups, not individual citizens, made social gains and produced social change. Individual blacks could not be considered equal to whites if blacks, as a racial group, were inferior to whites, as a racial group. Therefore, the black nationalist project used discourses of black authenticity to define practices to purify the black self from associations with whites, in order to produce an authentic black self distinguished from whites and other black political projects. The improvement of the black community took preference over practices of civic inclusion.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Additionally, the competing projects organized mutually exclusive affective practice.   The black nationalist project argued that authentic blacks expressed
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
239
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
their emotions because emotions were associated with the 'truth'. Unlike cognition, which is susceptible to manipulation, expressing emotions exhibited blacks' real reaction to discrimination and unfair treatment. They approached emotion as something that was natural and spontaneous in relation to the immediate context. Therefore, if one is unhappy, their real or authentic reaction should be unhappiness. The black nationalist project emphasized the expression of affective responses through bodily postures - yelling, screaming, kicking, pointing, fist waving, violent jerking the body, cringing the face etc. The black nationalist project used discourses of black authenticity to reject the rights project's idea that blacks should master affective responses in relation to white, and black adversaries. Because being angry and outraged were considered the natural and real black response to discrimination, the black nationalist project defined techniques to limit or manage affective outbursts as practice that denied what it meant to be black. Since the rights project used techniques of good black self to limit emotional outbursts in relation to nonviolent practices, encouraging emotional outbursts cemented ideas of violence and irrational practices with the black nationalist project. The idea was that authentic blacks used emotional responses to communicate their rejection racial discrimination, while good black citizens used rational dialog as part of their rejection of racial discrimination.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SNCC's adoption of the black nationalist project was related to questions of why and how groups become more 'revolutionary'. I have argued that the adoption of the black nationalist project resulted from how SNCC's grassroots project organized blacks and whites around the idea that they shared a common
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
240
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
geopolitical culture, thereby using discourses of good black citizenship to attach blacks and whites to a shared group of 'Mississippians'. Once SNCC made this move to organize around specified political groups located in shared local geopolitical cultures, rather than ideas that blacks and whites are generally 'Americans' and belong to the broadly defined nation-state territory, it provided openings for competing discourses of black authenticity to mobilize an idealized black only racial group in local geopolitical cultures. SNCC fully adopted the black nationalist project once they used discourses of black authenticity to mobilize a racially pure group that rejected associations with territory, becoming nomadic, and identifying with similar political projects and global racial groups.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SNCCs adoption of the black nationalist project can be broken down into stages. The first change in SNCC was how their grassroots project distinguished itself from the rights project by attaching the self to a political group within southern local geopolitical culture. We see a definitive change in mobilizing strategy in the shift from the rights project to the first transitional period. When they drew from the rights project, SNCC used sit-ins, and nonviolent practices in the Freedom Rides, and the Albany movement modeled after SCLC desegregation campaigns. During the first transitional period, when they began using a grassroots project SNCC organized the 1964 Freedom summer, resulting in the MFDP party. They instructed nonviolent civic practice, but also organized interracial political groups defined by Mississippi geopolitical culture.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The most important shift, which split the civil rights movement into two irreducible political projects, was the shift from the grassroots rights project to the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
241
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
grassroots black nationalist project. Here, SNCC used discourses of black authenticity to racialize the political group identity. Between the grassroots rights and the grassroots black nationalist periods, we can see a definitive shift in social and civic ethical practice. The grassroots black nationalist period featured social ethical practices of racial separation to organize all black political parties and political cells, and by 1966 expelled all whites from the organization. In the grassroots black nationalist period, SNCC members rejected nonviolent civic practices in favor of practices of self-defense. Unlike interracial and nonviolent practices of the rights and grassroots period, the grassroots black nationalist period attempted to organize all black parties that practiced self-defense in Lowndes County and Atlanta, Georgia.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The final shift was from the grassroots black nationalist period to the nomadic black nationalist political project. In the final shift, SNCC used discourses of black authenticity to define an idealized black only racial group attached to global struggles. Unlike the three previous periods, the shift to a black nationalist group rejected all territorial associations, in favor of a nomadic identification. American blacks were defined as lacking ideas of home and belonging, and were encouraged to identify and model subsequent strategies after global racial groups, specifically African and Middle Eastern, who shared experiences as racial minorities dominated by whites and used violent practices to fight for power. The Nation of Islam's black nationalist project was based on governing local geopolitical black cultures, mostly in Northeastern urban American ghettos, and establishing symbolic identifications with African colonial
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
242
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
struggles. Malcolm's post-Nation of Islam political work, and SNCC's struggles under Brown's leadership, represented attempts to organize around an idealized black nationalist model. Malcolm and SNCC under Brown's leadership made the nomadic identification that the Nation of Islam would or could not make (see Chapter 5). SNCC's only political work at this time was an attempted merger of SNCC and the Black Panther Party, which failed, and suggestions that blacks migrate back to Africa.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The next and final chapter is a case study on how the rights projected attached the idea of good black citizenship to the Voting Rights Act, which represented a shift in American political culture, and how it contributed to the split, and subsequent decline, of the civil rights movement. I concentrate on how the Voting Rights Act changed the subject and object of each political project. Specifically, I contrast 1) how the competing projects differed in directing their political practice at the national or local level for continued reform, 2) how each political project organized political programs and 'measured' black citizenship, 3) how each political project approached civic ethical practices, and 4) how they approached economic reform and urban revitalization.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
243
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
CHAPTER 5: THE 1965 VOTING RIGHTS ACT AND BLACK POLITICAL PRACTICE
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The last chapter left off explaining the impact of the black nationalist political project on the civil rights movement. It explained how the black nationalist project arose in response to the rights projects deracializing strategies, and how SNCC used discourses of black authenticity to produce a normative ideal of a revolutionary black political agent that contrasted to the rights political project idea of the good black citizen. In this chapter, I will analyze how the events surrounding the 1965 Voting Rights Act, including the Selma Movement 1963-1965 until the "end" of the movement in 1968, in order to understand 1) how the 1965 Voting Rights Act changed the object and subject of black civic practice and 2) the legacy of each political projects normative ideal of the black political agent. In essence, this chapter will show the importance of understanding reciprocity of cultural change and the development of social policy and political legislation on political practice. The rights project's normative idea of good black citizenship was the dominant representation of black citizenship attached to 1965 Voting Rights Act enabling it passage. However, the post-Voting Rights Act culture also affected subsequent civil rights strategies, as well as state juridical and police practices. Thus, the point of the chapter is to understand how political cultures influence the passage of major laws, legislation or political events, and the subsequent impact those major changes had on the civil rights movement civic practices.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
244
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The Voting Rights Act was a major piece of legislation that represented both the impact of the civil rights movement on American civic culture and the major turning point in how citizenship rights were distributed and interpreted. The Voting Rights Act ended all restrictions on voting for juridical citizens. The rights project's idea of basing citizenship on individual good citizen ethical practices rather than skin color helped displace the race-first distinction practices, and influenced the broader American and civic governing practices. Indeed, this change in political culture was not limited to blacks, whites or native citizens. The 1965 Immigration Act replaced the practice of basing immigration on country of origin in favor of basing immigration on skilled labor, to ensure the admittance of the "good immigrant".73
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Previous texts vary in their explanation of the importance of the Selma movement and 1965 Voting Rights Act. Fager (1974) used C. Vann Woodward's thesis on a new southern class structure to argue that Selma was important because it represented how the rise of a new southern class, which was racially tolerant and politically moderate, displaced the old agrarian southern elites that controlled southern life. For Fager, the Voting Rights Act represented the end of a larger transformation in the southern class structure, which allowed blacks to begin the process of integrating into a new southern society. David Garrow (1978) argued that the importance of Selma and the Voting Rights Act were
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
73 For information on how the Immigration Act changed American immigration, see King 2000 and Hing 2004. Additionally, the Asian-American groups, especially the Japanese and South Koreans, have benefited the most from the US need for high skilled labor, producing what sociologist refer to as the brain drain and the model minority myth for Asian American groups (see Prashad 2000). On the other hand, the Immigration Act has negatively affected Mexican immigrants, who fulfill menial and agricultural labor, and generally fulfill the scorn of American Immigration (Garcia 2002).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
245
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
simply the instrumental gains of winning new rights. Therefore, Selma represented the end of a long struggle geared around winning the right to vote. Doug McAdam (1999) representing the political process tradition, argued that the Voting Rights Act signaled the closing of a political opportunity. For him, the movement subsequently declined not because voting rights were the goal of the movement, or because a new southern class emerged that was more accepting of blacks. Rather, the movement declined because the black movement lacked 1) inter-organizational cooperation and 2) violent adversaries that prevented the movement from constructing their democratic and nonviolent frames to communicate their grievances with the rest of America.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
There are major shortcomings for each of these explanations. First, there is no reason to believe that social class determines the degree of racial tolerance. Wealthy and middle class whites racially discriminated against blacks just as often as poor whites. Indeed, the rise of the White Citizens Council throughout the south was due to white professionals, lawyers, businessmen, and government administrators distinguishing themselves from the associations of rural poverty and "white trash" attributed to the Ku Klux Klan. Second, it makes little sense to reduce political legislation to measurements of instrumental gains. In light of how the cultural turn in sociology, which highlighted the many ways social movements are important i.e., solidarity, empowerment, etc, illustrated that legislation has broader political and cultural implications. Third, the idea of a political opportunity closing after the 1965 Voting Rights Act neglects how the Johnson Administration continued ties with the movement on a proposed 1966
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
246
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Civil Rights Act (eventually passed in 1968) that tackled housing discrimination. Furthermore, each of these explanations placed too much emphasis on the piece of legislation, assuming that changes in political structure created cultural changes. The previous four chapters have argued that the civil rights movement's symbolic citizenship claims produced a cultural change that allowed for the passage of the Voting Rights bill. Our task here is to understand how reciprocity existed between cultural changes and political acts and legislation.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Based on archival data (movement reports, manuals, meetings, correspondences) and historical comparative methodology, this chapter uses Selma and the 1965 Voting Rights Act as a case to understand how the competing political projects symbolic citizenship claims changed American political culture, state governing practices, and subsequent civil rights political practices. The Voting Rights Act main impact was that it made the struggle for the right to vote and organizing around voter registration practices obsolete. Although the rights project continued to use discourses of good black citizenship to organize their citizenship schools and produce good black citizens, the main functions of the citizenship schools and community centers was instructing blacks how to beat the literacy tests. The competing projects and cultures were open to new questions of urban revitalization of black ghettos, slums and neighborhoods, and questions of whether to pressure the nation-state or local state levels of government for economic rights. Additionally, I propose that we understand the decline of a social movement separately from the outcomes of a political project. The movement declined for a number of reasons, including new
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
247
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
and more intense forms of state police practice and the failure of competing civil rights groups to work together. However, the rights and black nationalist political project remained important in shaping a black identity politics that emerged on the American political scene in the late 1960s and early 1970s. I argue the black nationalist project forced the rights project to consider the good black/bad black normative distinction, which the rights project could not, because they were unable to deracialize a claim of racial authenticity. Although the black nationalist project retreated to the margins of national public sphere, primarily to the subaltern publics found in local urban cities, its lasting legacy provided the implicit argument undermining subsequent black political practice - is it black enough? Next, I will provide a brief history and overview of the events leading up the Voting Rights Act, and points of contestation between the rights project and grass roots project, which opened up ontological space for the black nationalist project.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
HISTORY AND OVERVIEW OF THE SELMA MOVEMENT AND 1965 VOTING RIGHTS ACT
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The Selma movement began to take shape in 1963, when SNCC's grassroots project began organizing Dallas County's black community. An important part of SNCC's grassroots project was the practice of collecting and documenting information on local blacks, especially relations between local blacks and Selma's police, government, and economic workings. They did this in order to produce a working knowledge of the area that helped inform civil rights organizations of the challenges each local geopolitical culture posed.    This

              &lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
included SNCC's use of the existing black gangs in Selma, especially the gang's networks within the black community, and high school students to help with voter canvassing, registration and organizing weekly citizenship training meetings.74 In 1963, SNCC reported that only 0.9% of Selma's black population was registered to vote, despite comprising 57.7% of Selma's overall population.75 Because blacks were the numerical majority in many rural black-belt counties, SNCC began their "One Man One Vote" campaign to increase the number of black voters. SNCC argued that, "the Negroes of Selma and Dallas County are politically impotent without the vote. They have no way of influencing the choice of those who hold public office, even though they are in the majority" (RF 1-1). Thus, the idea that the right to vote would provide the foundational practice to gain political power emerged at the start of the Selma Movement.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
While the struggle to produce voting rights legislation was important for gaining political power, the political projects symbolic citizenship claims organized how they made claims for voting rights. SNCC, as well as SCLC when they arrived in 1965, used discourses of good black citizenship to instruct blacks how to master civic ethical practices. As police violence and brutality increased, the movement brought in medical personnel and physicians to instruct blacks how to control the body when tear-gassed. One medical doctor instructed how to respond to tear gas: "You think you're blinded and the danger is you'll panic and rub your eyes.    Don't rub your eyes.    You'll be blinded temporarily.    Don't

panic. Additionally, the movement instructed blacks on how to manage being trampled by horses, by not running from the horses but "try to grab the reins and stay in front of him."77 However, SNCC noted that protecting the body was difficult when being trampled by a horse because police were also using tear gas, and that practicing bodily postures of the limp position was useless when kicked by a horses hoof. Thus, despite the increasing influence of the black nationalist project, the Selma movement continued to train blacks how to master good black citizenship practices.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
That SCLC and SNCC last worked together in Selma is important to understand why and how the movement split and declined. They both used discourses of good black citizenship that 1) attached the idea of the good black citizen with the images of the black political agent that was being integrated into the national polity and 2) represented the symbiotic relationship between the rights and grassroots political projects. Because both political projects used discourses of good black citizenship, the good black citizen was the symbolic citizenship claim attached to the Voting Rights Act. The symbiotic relationship between the rights and grassroots project was also important because it allowed the civil rights movement to pressure the state on different levels. The rights project focused their civic practices on the nation-state level, to induce the national government to enforce existing rights and produce new rights to protect blacks from racial discrimination. In contrast, the grassroots project sought to organize blacks locally, to train them how to integrate and pressure city, county

and state governments to enforce desegregation laws. When the rights and grassroots projects worked together, they were able to organize broad movements, like Freedom Summer, Birmingham and Selma.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
While the civil rights movement used discourses of good black citizenship to discipline and organize black civic practice to pressure the state on different levels, the different political levels - federal, state, county and city - differed on how to police the movement. The difference was rooted in the competing "new south" and "old south" revitalization projects. The idea behind the new south revitalization project was to produce a cosmopolitan civic image and set of practices that 'modernized' the south, by embracing a service sector economy, limiting the political influence of rural counties, and minimizing racial tensions. In contrast, the old south revitalization project attempted to strengthen the south's existing, but declining, industrial and agricultural bases with corporate tax cuts and suppressing black and white wage earners, in order to produce southern autonomy from northern cultural influence and federal legislation. Whereas the new south project attempted to integrate the south into the broader American governing structure, and in turn benefit from federal money and investment, the old south project sought southern autonomy from the federal government and northern cultural influence. The primary difference between the southern revitalization projects was how they policed the civil rights movement. Although neither revitalization project sought racial equality, the new south project sought desegregation and limited the use of violence on protesters. The differences and struggles   between   the   competing   projects   became   more   important  after

Ask your self this important question: what have I personally done to maintain segregation? Is it worth four dollars to prevent a 'Birmingham' here? Law enforcement can be called in only after these things occur, but your citizens council prevents them from happening. Is it worth four dollars to you to prevent sit-ins, mob marches and wholesale Negro voter registration in Selma?78
&lt;/p&gt;

Since the Citizens' Council was a white power organization comprised of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
professionals, including police, lawyers, and politicians, they felt that if they had

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
south project is best understood in relation to the old south police practices, especially the use of violence, favored by Dallas County Sherriff Jim Clark and Alabama Director of Public Safety and head of the State Police Al Lingo.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The old south project organized police practices around the idea of violence and containment. For the old south, the idea of violence encompassed physical violence, verbal harassment, and figurative bodily violence. In 1963, the Dallas County police chief Jim Clark organized a 'semi-professional' police force. In contrast to a professional police force that was organized bureaucratically and received institutionalized training on techniques to handle crowds and keep order, Clark's semi-professional police force was more of patronage based private security team, which received no professional training and was loyal to him. They were autonomous from the authority of the Alabama State Police and Selma's public safety director. Because Americans have the right to form independent militias, Clark never violated any state or federal laws. When SNCC began organizing Dallas County blacks in 1963, they documented how Clark had deputized between 200 and 500 white males into a "special vigilante force." Clark's semi-professional police dressed in old army fatigues, army helmets and boots, and attended SNCC meetings holding guns and electric cattle prods.79 Secondly, the idea of containment practices refereed to isolating black protesters in certain geographical segregated spaces. Policed restricted blacks from leaving the black neighborhoods, and forced them to enter through the back doors of the segregated courthouse building. They stopped and arrested close to 100 high-school students on charges of 'truancy', as the students, not affiliated 79 SAV48-2 "Special Report: Selma Alabama" 26 September 1963, RF 1-1

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
with the movement, walked along the streets (RF 1-1). Thus, the grassroots and rights project set their civic practices in relation to the old south practices in order to 1) establish the good black/ bad white binary and 2) apply pressure between the Selma, Dallas County and the State of Alabama's differing governing practices to produce political opportunities.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The Selma movement, therefore, escalated their civic practices in January of 1965. They began a series of marches to the Dallas County courthouse, looking to isolate situations where they could situate good black civic practices against old south police practices. On the one hand, the new south police practices, led by Public Safety Director Wilson Baker, used surveillance practices to watch and manage the marches, by forcing them to march 2 or 3 to a group, with spaces in between each group of protesters. The idea behind surveillance practices was to limit any momentum and excitement generated by the protests. On the other hand, the old south police practices, led by Jim Clark, harassed, arrested, and eventually began using physical violence. The 'tipping point' for the old south project was when civil rights protester Amelia Boyton berated Clark over his treatment of blacks, eventually hit him, baiting Clark into beating and dragging her a block.80 The irony of that situation was Boyton's lack of self-mastery over her affective and bodily practices helped the movement. In this case, the gendered assumption of black women helped 'excuse' her lack of self-mastery and hysterical response, thereby maintaining the good black/bad white binary.  Although the new south police practices were working, and SCLC was

254
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
making plans to switch the movement to another Alabama county, there are two reasons why the old south police practices became the dominant style of police practice. First, the old south police practices had the support of Governor George Wallace and rural whites from neighboring counties. Therefore the old southern culture, which was geographically dispersed, had a common 'enemy' and focal point to converge on. Second, for the old south project, the style its officials policed the civil rights movement was more important than just defeating them, because an old south victory ensured the spread of the old south project, especially the idea of producing southern autonomy. Indeed, instrumental outcomes of winning and achieving desired results were less important than which political ideas and cultures would dominate southern politics.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The dominance of the old south project, based on the county-state political coalition, helped the Selma Movement because they were able to isolate the good black/ bad white binary necessary to make their symbolic citizenship claims that blacks were idealized American citizens deserving of rights. The importance of isolating the good black/ bad white binary helps us understand the defining 'event' of Selma, known as "Bloody Sunday". On 7 March 1965, the Selma movement led what was supposed to be a march from Selma to Montgomery Alabama. When the marchers, led by SNCC's Lewis and SCLC's Hosea Williams81 advanced across the Pettus Bridge, Clark's vigilante posses and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
That King was absent from Bloody Sunday, as well as his actions in the second Selma to Montgomery march when he ordered the marchers to return to AME church after the police stood on the side of the road to let the march continue, has been a point of contestation for King bibliographers and Civil Rights historians. Regarding this debate, including King's advance knowledge of what the police would do, his courage, and willingness to go to jail for the movement (see Lewis 1970, Garrow 1986, Fairclough 1987).

4:16 pm-police are beating people on the streets. Oh, man, they're just picking them up and putting them in ambulance. People are getting hurt pretty bad. There are two people on the ground in pretty bad shape. I'm going to leave in a few minutes - people are running back this way. 4:17 pm - Ambulances are going by with their sirens going. People are running, crying, telling what's happening.82
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Police chased and beat blacks back to the black church located in the black

              &lt;p&gt;
neighborhood.    In the ensuring police onslaught, SNCC leader John Lewis
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
suffered a fractured skull.    Bloody Sunday was broadcasted nationally and
&lt;/p&gt;

and public discussion in favor of national Voting Rights legislation.83

decline. The march made it to Montgomery, marching through areas marked by rural white and black poverty, and arriving at the Montgomery State Capital building, where King gave a speech asking how long it would take for Voting Rights legislation to be passed in relation to events of Bloody Sunday. However, during the march, field notes indicated that the black nationalist project dominated intra-movement discussion, especially on role of whites in the Selma movement, self-defense, and whether nonviolence was only effective if it provoked violence.85 Additionally, Johnson's national remark about prosecuting and eliminating the Klan because they killed white housewife Viola Liuzzo while driving a black activist, angered black activists who were already questioning the merits of nonviolence and integration, and believed that whites only cared about the well-being of other whites.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
THE MOVEMENT SPLITS: THE RIGHTS PROJECT VERSUS THE BLACK NATIONALIST PROJECT
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The passage and events surrounding the Voting Rights Act had immediate impact on the civil rights movement's civic practices. The movement as a whole faced the question of what to do next. For the rights project, the questions were whether the right to vote was enough to obtain political power, and what would replace voting as the dominant issue to organize movement programs and attract new black activists? Indeed, these questions permeated throughout SCLC's Dallas County Project. In a 'Church Service Pamphlet' asking for donations of books, green stamps and money, the project's director Shirley Mesher wrote "But what was behind the need for the vote - oppression and a never ending cycle of 85 CC 1-7 Catherin Clarke's notes on the Montgomery March
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
257
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
poverty - remains... And the vote is meaningless unless people have a choice. In light of continued forms of black-white inequality, the rights project began to focus more on, in Marshall's terms, the economic and social rights of impoverished blacks and whites. In contrast, after the Voting Rights Act, SNCC abandoned its grassroots project in favor of black nationalist project, and pressured local governments to enforce existing political and economic rights.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
To understand how the movement 'split', we need to understand how the two competing political projects 1) approached citizenship and 2) how the Voting Rights act shaped the question and practices of what to do next. First, as I argued in chapters 1-3, the rights project made symbolic citizenship claims that produced a deracialized black self, which represented idealized American citizenship, in an effort to attach the black self to the nation-state. That is, the rights project used ideas of liberalism that isolated each individual and their set of rights/duties as an indicator of the basis of membership and exclusion. In contrast, the black nationalist project attached the black self to the racial group first, then the nation-state. That is, they rejected the idea of individual rights in favor of the idea that citizenship is the property of groups - primarily racial and ethnic groups. Therefore, the differences between the rights and nationalist project approach to citizenship represented the difference, in part, between a liberal and multicultural approach to citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Although the competing political projects split the movement, some activists never fully embraced either project 100%. However, since the rights and black nationalist project were the two dominant positions producing 86 CC 1-7 "Church Service Pamphlet"
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
258
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
influential normative ideas of black political agents, black activists gravitated toward one pole or the other. In other words, activists tended to cluster at either extreme, staking out positions in this debate. For instance, the NAACP's national office, the Urban League and SCLC's governing committees definitely supported deracialized strategies, but were made up of many supporters who did not fully embraced the use of nonviolence. Even King used armed bodyguards to protect him from the increasing death threats. How activists responded to SNCC's transition to a black nationalist group was even more nuanced. SNCC's local projects in Atlanta, Pine Bluff, and Lowndes County increasingly used discourses of black authenticity to organize all black groups in relation local setbacks, and the perception that the rights project national campaign excluded blacks bounded by urban ghettos. After Selma, SNCC activists who did not agree with the all black organizing joined SCLC's SCOPE program or dropped out. Lester (1976) noted that many in the Atlanta project, including himself, struggled with the black nationalist position. Coincidently, an influential white activist in SNCC, Jack Minnis, led the political coup to out John Lewis, because many in SNCC saw his religious conviction as interfering with SNCC's revolutionary potential (Carson 1995). Minnis rallied SNCC members to replace Lewis with Carmichael, because of Carmichael's socialist and secular leanings. Despite the apparent hesitation and reservation of some activists, they nevertheless took positions within this political debate. Therefore, my focus will remain on how projects drew from competing discourses to organize normative symbolic citizenship claims and how these claims marked political projects.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
259
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to the different approaches to citizenship, the Voting Rights Act shaped the questions, and subsequent practice, of what to do next. Each political project had to adapt their set of ethical practices in a political field that no longer practiced blatant racial discrimination, such as voter restrictions or legal segregation. In contrast to civil rights historiography that conflates the movements split with its decline/end, and views the Selma to Montgomery March as the conclusion to the movement, I will show how the split between the political projects did not end the movement. Indeed, the rights project continued the struggle in Chicago over economic issues of open housing, and sought to produce an economic bill of rights with a national "Poor Peoples Movement" (see Garrow 1986: 431-624, Ralph 1993, McKnight 1998). Additionally, I will show how the Atlanta Project and the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO) used discourses of black authenticity to organize civic practice in relation to questions of urban revitalization and the black sovereignty. The remainder of this section will analyze the differences in each political projects 1) strategy of local versus national organizing, 2) the pedagogy of movement programs, 3) civic ethical practice and 4) urban revitalization practices. Local Organizing Versus National Organizing
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
After the Voting Rights Act, the rights project sought integrated civic practices, based on coalition of groups stratified by race and issues, which sought influence on the nation-state level. The rights project continued to use a discourse and language of rights to make claims that Americans needed an 'economic bill of rights' that would "guarantee a job to all people who want to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
260
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
work and are able to work" and "guarantee an income for all who are not able to work" (King [1968] 1986: 67). However, they shifted their strategy from voter registration to using the black vote as a way to form political alliances. The rights project argued that blacks should form political alliances based on what is best for blacks and the political party, without giving up black political independence as a voting bloc or influential political group. Blacks were to be a political group no different from a labor or political advocacy group. This differed from SNCC, as both a grassroots and black nationalist project, which favored pressuring local geopolitical cultures (e.g. the city, county and federal state level) and organizing black only racial groups. After the Voting Rights Act, SNCC produce a memo tiled "How to take advantage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act". They argued, "A large segment of the national power lies in the Congressional seats from states and districts that have from one forth to one half of their voters Negro... registration concentrated in a selected number of states and congressional districts should produce a marked change in the political complexion of the country."87 This included running black candidates in primaries and elections to unseat southern senators and congressmen who sat on key committees.88 Whereas the rights project felt that pressuring the federal government was the best approach, in part because the federal government could supersede local governing practices, evidenced in the Birmingham and Selma movements,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
88  For instance, in 1965 SNCC noted that Medall Rivers, whose congressional district was 44% black, was chair of the House Armed Forces Committee, and Rich Russell, whole district was 29% black, was the Senate Chair of the Armed Services Committee and Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriation Committee, could be displaced if blacks could be sufficiently organized and registered to vote (see (RY Box 1 Folder Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Reports, Memos, Research Papers 1965-67)
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
261
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
SNCC focused on removing bad whites from powerful and influential positions in local government and congressional seats to produce more immediate change.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
For the rights project, the most important post-Voting Rights civic ethical practices to master were the affective responses in relation direct action and coalition politics. While nonviolent direct action rested on the ability to master bodily postures and affective responses, coalition politics required mastering the affective style of rhetorical practices. It was important for blacks to master a rational style of speech because it helped establish mutual understanding and benefits for the involved political groups. In part, the style of rhetorical ethics of coalition building were the antithesis of Habermas's rational-critical discourse, where strength of argumentation is decisive (see Habermas [1962] 1991). Ideally, the rights project sought to replace direct action with coalition politics. The rights project used direct action to force whites into positions of negotiation. By using coalition politics, the rights project hoped to bypass the first step and enter directly into negotiation practices. In an influential 1964 essay titled "From Protest to Politics", Bayard Rustin argued the civil rights movement would have to consider how to act on the larger political (federal) stage without direct action. He noted that as blacks began to obtain political power through voter education and registration efforts, "a tactical shift is being effected. Direct action techniques are being subordinated to a strategy calling for the building of community institutions or power bases" (Rustin [1964] 1971: 112). Rustin argued that coalition strategies allowed the movement to organize blacks they were registering into a political voting bloc.  Although the black vote did not hold that

much power nationally, it could alter election outcomes in southern states where blacks made up a sizable minority population. Black voting blocs meant neither Southern Democrats nor Republicans could ignore blacks or take them for granted.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Although many black leaders, specifically King, did not fully embrace the idea of abandoning direct action in favor of coalition building, the idea of pressuring the federal government and forming interracial coalitions dominated the rights projects in Chicago and SCLC's Poor Peoples Movement. The rights project sought to combat urban poverty in Chicago. They settled on housing issues, which was the dominant issue in the 1968 Civil Rights Act. The rights project attempted to use Chicago as a case that represented 'dual-housing' market that denied good black citizens the right to buy housing in more affluent and middleclass white neighborhoods. SCLC networked with local Chicago civic organizations, including the Chicago Council of Community Organizing (CCCO), the Catholic Church, academics and the CFL-IUC labor union. Additionally, the rights project used this same discourse of rights issues to argue why impoverished citizens needed protection from poverty. They sought to recruit blacks, whites, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Native Americans based on the idea that they all shared common economic hardships. McKnight described this last phase of the civil rights movement as a "populist crusade calling for the redistribution of economic and political power" (McKnight 1998: 23).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In contrast to the rights project strategy of forming coalitions and using local movements to pressure the federal government into producing new rights,

&lt;/p&gt;

SNCC directed their political practices at the local level. This change of political practice and local strategy in SNCC produced two semi-autonomous political groups, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO) and the Atlanta Project, linked by common discursive strategies that tied both to a single political project and with SNCC's central committee. The Atlanta Project, also called the Vine City Project, formed after the Georgia Legislature refused to allow Julian Bong to assume his newly elected position in the state senate because of his anti-Vietnam war position. The Atlanta project represented how SNCC's semi-autonomous political cells adopted black nationalist practices. Although the Atlanta project was the largest in terms of activists and influence over the SNCC's central committee, there was also SNCC projects in Pine Bluff, Arkansas and Lowndes County Alabama who were also adopting black nationalist practices. As far back as 1963 in Pine Bluff, for instance, SNCC worker, NAACP member and black Muslim Robert Whitfield sponsored and encouraged stand-ins, sit-is and the picketing of a McDonald's restaurant to protest the continued practice of segregated diners.89 In 1964 in Lowndes County, Alabama, under the organizing efforts of Stokely Carmichael, blacks began adopting black nationalist practices of forming independent black political parties, which resulted in the formation of LCFO. Below, I will focus primarily on the Atlanta Project, with some reflections on how they adopted political strategies from the other political cells. For the purposes of this dissertation, the Atlanta Project provides the best case of how the black nationalist project political practice and organizing strategies in

the civil rights movement, since it was located in urban black ghetto in a southern city.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In addition to the campaign to seat Julian Bond in the state legislature, the Atlanta Project organized around the issues of challenging local slumlords, racial discrimination in employment practices, police brutality, and the practices of drafting blacks into the army and fighting abroad.90 Despite their attempts to produce and govern autonomous black communities, the SNCC proceeded with attempts to place authentic blacks in the civic sphere as symbolic gesture to communicate to other blacks involved in the movement that there were alternatives to the rights project. SNCC, and especially the Atlanta Project, wanted to prove to blacks that they could master techniques of authentic black self while interacting with whites and still represent the interests of the black community without compromise. Therefore, the Bond seating issue provided an opportunity for the Atlanta Project to declare their break from the rights project and implement black nationalist practices. They used discourses of black authenticity to argue that, "The civil rights movement is dead. With the passage of the civil rights and voting rights bills, all legal measures for securing civil rights for black people in this country have been exhausted. All civil rights demonstrations aimed at securing jobs, integration of schools, better housing, and an end to police brutality, have ended in tokenism, compromise, and in most

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The black nationalist project had its strongest support in black neighborhoods of

culture. Unlike other southern black communities, Atlanta's blacks could register to vote. Since voter registration practices were no longer necessary, the question became how to use the power to vote to obtain political power. We have to understand the Atlanta Project's shift in directing their political practice at the local level as an attempt to produce and govern a sovereign black political community, which was the Atlanta Project's break from any affiliation with the rights project. This strategy represents how the black nationalist project approached citizenship as the property of racial groups. The first step towards black political sovereignty was electing black political officials who answered to black constituents. Rather than merge with the local Democratic or Republican Party, they printed material on forming a new political party. One pamphlet, on how to organize a new political party, reprinted section 34-901 of the Georgia Code that outlined the five practices necessary for establishing a new political party and how to place candidates on the ballot for general election.94 By organizing locally, the Atlanta Project hoped to place a sizable black presence in city councils and state governments so whites could no longer politically afford to neglect and discriminate against black citizens.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The second practice was using discourses of black authenticity to racially purify the object and subject of the Atlanta project's goals. This meant creating black political administrators, such as sheriffs, tax assessors, and mayors to
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
93 The Atlanta project outlined their local strategy, which was reflected SNCC's as a whole, in their prospectus "For the first time, it has become possible in the south to shift the movements focus away from the federal government as a major agent of change... As a result the emphasis can now be directed to achieving a real voice over the conduct of local government - on the municipal, county and state levels. The state assembly district and the possibility of grass roots expression is in reality much greater than the federal government." MS "Prospectus for an Atlanta Project"

govern and care for the black community. After the 1965 Voting Rights Act, Carmichael noted that SNCC workers should "address themselves to the logistics of self-determination: getting a Negro sheriff into office winning power" and practical matters of building better roads in the black community.96 Additionally, using ideas of racial authenticity to organize their goals meant expanding black political practices to areas and issues that did not reflect the standpoint of 'good blacks', but rather, urban black subjects associated with authentic blackness. The Atlanta project organized around topics that the rights project would not, such as racial discrimination experienced by black prisoners. They challenged state practices that de-feminized imprisoned black women, which marginalized black women both as blacks and as women. Specifically, they protested the state incarceration practice of forcing black women to wear men's undergarments, and do domestic labor of cooking and cleaning, while white women sewed and wore women's undergarments.97 Extending protest practices to issues that did not represent good black citizens contrasted sharply with the rights project that centered on the ethical rhetoric that blacks deserve rights because they represent idealized citizens.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
An important part of SNCC efforts to establish all black political parties at the local level was rejecting coalition politics. Although the idea of forming political coalition is not limited to organizing on the federal level, organizing racial

groups at the local level placed boundaries between SNCC's political practices and any other groups, including black groups perceived as not black enough. On the one hand, the black nationalist project questioned the idea that whites really cared about the black community, and the broader white polity's willingness for racial equality. Carmichael argued that one reason for organizing black only parties was that "there are no white moderates in Alabama. That state voted wholeheartedly for Wallace. If there are to be any coalition, then people have to go into the white community and develop that base."98 Whereas the rights project sought allies outside of the local geopolitical area organized, such as northern Protestant, Quaker, labor and student groups, the black nationalist focus on local organizing produced boundaries between them and other groups. On the other hand, SNCC rejected political participation at the national level, which distanced SNCC from other civil rights groups. In May 1966, they rejected an invitation to a white house conference on civil rights, with Carmichaels declaring that, "integration is irrelevant. Political and economic power is what black people have to have."99 Furthermore, SNCC created a press release arguing that the federal government was shifting the burden of improving black communities to blacks.100 Whereas the rights project used meetings with the president as opportunities to discuss new legislation and ask for additional rights, SNCC used federal opportunities to associate the state and other black political projects with whiteness and the idea that neither was capable of solving the

economic problems faced by black communities.    The "go it alone" and revolutionary strategy of SNCC limited their political practice to local areas. Pedagogical Practices: Freedom Schools and Community Centers
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
After Selma, the rights project continued using discourses of good black citizenship to organize citizenship schools and role-playing workshops. Their main attempt at establishing citizenship schools throughout the south was through the Southern Community Organization and Political Education (SCOPE) program. SCLC modeled the SCOPE program after the 1964 Freedom Summer. The SCOPE project sought to continue the pedagogical practice of instructing good black citizenship, and even sought to include training sessions on public health and the body, specifically "information on medical, dental hygiene, nutrition education, and birth control information" (CC 3-3). The idea behind SCOPE was to take advantage of the impending 1965 Voting Rights Act and register thousands of blacks to vote in order to change southern politics.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Although SCLC's citizenship schools were intertwined with the movement's ability to attach the idea of good black citizenship onto the southern black polity, the Voting Rights Act denied the citizenship schools their manifest function of voter registration and creating new political rights, which brought in teachers, students, and economic funding. The Voting Rights Act outlawed literacy tests and poll taxes. SCLC used the idea of passing citizenship tests as main reason to attend the schools. Armed with the right to vote, SCLC had to convince blacks that the citizenship schools were still useful. SCOPE, therefore, functioned more like the pre-citizenship school program that measured black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
270
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
citizenship in terms of number of black voters registered rather than the quality of citizenship practice. This is not to say that ideas of good black citizenship became less important. Indeed, the black nationalist challenge had the opposite effect on the rights project. It meant that without a practical obstacle like literacy tests, the SCOPE program lost a very important recruiting and organizing issue to get blacks to attend their schools.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
A second post-Voting Right effect on the SCOPE program was the shift in types of volunteers. The post-Selma SCOPE recruits desired more action and confrontation rather than the mundane labor of the political organizer. Movement programs, such as citizenship schools and Freedom Summer relied more on volunteers willing to teach, instruct and correct personal and social ethical practices rather than concentrate on mastering civic ethical practices. Indeed, the restlessness of the recruits prompted a memo from SCOPE'S program director Hosea Williams that indicated SCOPE was a voter registration project and that "this is not a time for demonstrations" (CC 3-3). Furthermore, the rights project's strategy of appealing to the federal government and new involvement in the north, which limited their presence in southern communities, also affected the rights project surveillance and disciplining practices of the volunteers. This led to the abuse of SCOPE funds, and lackadaisical volunteer labor. Consequently, the SCOPE project increased infighting amongst SCLC staffers and community leaders, as well as FBI surveillance on the SCLC (see Garrow 1986: 440-442, 451-452).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
271
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Similar to SCLC, SNCC was never able to organize anything on the scale of the 1964 Freedom Summer Campaign. SNCC's split from the other political projects limited their capacity to organize large-scale movement programs. The overall infrastructure and organization of Freedom Summer was based largely on SCLC's Citizenship School model (see chapter 3). Although SCLC continued to invite SNCC to participate in citizenship schools and workshops, SNCC did not take part. SNCC also refused to use the SCLC citizenship model, in part, because SNCC's black nationalist project wanted to organize the black community without the black church, and viewed the citizenship schools as too white.101 Despite the split, SNCC continued to plan and attempt new schools and community centers designed to help blacks at the local level. This included 1) tutorial programs 2) domestic management programs 3) community center programs and 4) medical self-care programs.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
First, SNCC's grass roots and black nationalist project designed tutorial programs, which focused on school-aged children, to supplement existing public school education. In the summer of 1965, SNCC set up five tutorial centers, 227 workshops, and enrolled 943 students.102 Rather than report cards that graded students work on a scale of A - F, the tutorial program rated how the students mastered personal practices from a scale of "below average to above average". The tutorial program evaluated the students eagerness to learn, attentiveness,
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
speech and self-expression, behavior, and academic improvement.103 This idea of evaluating black students distinguished the tutorial programs from Freedom Summer, which primarily sought to raise awareness of black history among black students, and provide instruction for adults on how to care for children and upkeep on the physical structure of the house. It also differed from the SCOPE citizenship schools, which emphasized mastering good black personal, social and civic ethical practices. We can see how this switch to evaluating black students coincided with the black nationalist project of evaluating black political agents on what constituted techniques of an authentic black self. As noted in chapter 4, the black nationalist project evaluated blacks in terms of bodily and affective practices, as well as a political rhetoric of revolution. The practice of evaluating blackness rather than just instructing authentic black practices became the major point of contestation within the black nationalist project.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Similar to the Freedom Summer community centers, SNCC wanted to focus on domestic practices of maintaining ones home and family. For 1965/1966, SNCC proposed programs on childcare practices, home management, and citizenship.104 Unlike the freedom summer community centers, SNCC sought to expand their pedagogical techniques to include how to make a budget and plan for food, and marital counseling to counsel black couples, as a way to maintain the unity of black families. Furthermore, the black communities need for medical care, and the states inability to provide it, led SNCC to expand on Freedom Summer's medical programs, and develop a

general "Health Education Program". The Health Education Program suggested focusing on medical practices specific to the black community, including birth control, baby care, common childhood illnesses, nutrition and diet, sanitation and hygiene, pest control, venereal disease, arthritis, heart disease, strokes, high blood pressure."105 The idea of the community centers was used not just to organize blacks politically, but also to provide immediate and practical benefits to the local black population. In essence, the rights project inability to develop local projects hurt their ability to organize black communities, urban and rural, on their own. It also indicated how the rights projected needed other black political groups to work with who were willing to do the mundane and unglamorous organizing work. SNCC, on the other hand, did not have the resources to implement their community centers on any kind of scale to reach impoverished blacks. Nevertheless, the idea that the black community faced extraordinary levels of poverty and medical needs, which marked the black body with harmful stereotypes, was the dominant organizing issue in both SNCC's grassroots and black nationalist programs.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In contrast to the SCOPE program's good black citizen pedagogy, SNCC sought to implement cultural programs in their community centers that would teach black history to black youths and black people in the community, as well as inform blacks on available legal services in relation to neighborhood problems, illegal   police  searches,   evictions,   and   traffic  violations.106     Whereas  the

citizenship schools continued to shape a deracialized black self by instructing non-violent practices, and linking blacks within the context of 'American history', the Atlanta Project focused on shaping an authentic black self by instructing black history. Rather than discipline black bodies to master forms of civic practice to influence state practice and legislation, the Atlanta project sought to use the existing legal framework to enforce existing rights that protect blacks from abuses of state power. The difference between using a nation-state history versus using a racial history to define the black political self and blacks' position within the American civic framework reflect the different practice of attaching the self to the racial group versus the nation-state. Civic Practices and Black Leaders
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The rights project continued to instruct black activists how to master nonviolent civic practices. They used workshops to train blacks how to protect the body, absorb pain, and master affective responses while marching and picketing. During the Chicago campaign, for example, SCLC held workshops before each march through white neighborhoods. Whites responded to the marches by throwing rocks, bottles, and burning cars. However, the Voting Rights Act and SNCC's adoption of the black nationalist project changed how they organized two forms of civic practices: 1) the increased importance of the black leader and 2) the use of affective stimuli in public protests.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
First, SNCC changed how they trained activists to be political leaders. In contrast to SNCC's grassroots leadership training, which emphasized mastering social ethical practices necessary for establishing networks amongst various
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
275
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black groups, SNCC emphasized the role of black leaders providing the example for other blacks to follow. SNCC used discourses of black authenticity to attach a sense of idolatry to black leaders. In some respects, this is how SNCC viewed Malcolm X - as an authentic black man who mastered techniques of authentic black self, and whose 'body and soul' were worthy of emulation. We see this change in a manual produced by Jim Forman in 1967 titled "On Political Organizing" that was distributed to activists attending the 1967 meetings.107 Forman wrote this manual in an attempt to increase the amount of self-discipline within SNCC, which he saw as lacking and the major reason for SNCC's declining relevance in the civil rights movement. For Forman, SNCC activists had to focus on mastering personal ethical practices, so that other blacks knew how to model their own practices.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Forman defined the good leader as one who mastered personal ethical practices of hard work. More than any other practice, the quality of the leader's labor determined how affective he/she was. Forman argued that there was a set of characteristic inherent to all black organizers and leaders. The characteristics inherent of a "good organizer" included creativity, a self-starter, a self-pusher, has a goal in mind, does not expect others will follow a phony lead, and pays attention to detail.108 A bad leader was one who could not master the work ethic of a self-starter. He failed not because of resistance or reluctance of the black community to be involved, but "from taking on too many jobs, inadequate

planning or record keeping, and sometimes downright laziness."109 The idea of mastering personal ethical practices legitimated authentic 'strong' black leaders, who were necessary to govern black communities. Leaders provided a physical and symbolic presence that represented the unity and strength of the black community to whites. In contrast to the notion of charismatic leadership associated with the black preacher-turned-activist, which organized how SCLC selected leaders (see Morris 1984) authentic black political leaders lead by practice. That is, they show they are willing to do what it takes, including the mundane and banal work of political organizing, to set an example of how things should be done. Forman made no mention of the importance of social ethical practices when working with others. Rather than let volunteers set up and run political meetings, the black leader assigns administrative duties to members. The black leader should transfer "certain skills, information, contacts, training and association" that 'he' posses to others.110
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The lack of reflexivity between organizer and organized heightened the sense of personal responsibility of black leaders, which Forman argued should be constantly examined. He argued the, "The acid test of effective leadership by the political organizer is his willingness to submit his role for examination, evaluation and criticism... naturally, he must be willing to evaluate his own efforts, to admit mistakes, to correct them and move on, for there is work to be done."111 Good leaders examined the self because their practices reverberated throughout the organization and affected the civic practices of others.   Rather

than a process of interrelated ideas informing the shape of civic practices, the leader was the center of the social group, which all ideas, decisions and strategy went through. If the leader faulted, then all subsequent political practice of the group was impotent. Furthermore, he argued that good leaders "must constantly improve his own intellectual development. He must take time to study, to read, to write, to rest. He must constantly evaluate his actions and the actions of others and discuss them collectively with his friends and fellow workers."112 For Forman, the idolatry of black leaders meant they must constantly stay ahead of existing political and cultural events in order to justify their leadership and remain influential, indeed relevant, in the black political community.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The second change in civic practice was the use of affective stimuli to provoke anger and 'moral shocks' in blacks and whites. Although the idea of a political demonstration was not the civic practice of choice for the black nationalist project, the Atlanta Project continued to protest, albeit with style of civic practice that represented their break from the rights project and rejection of American political policy and cultural norms. First, the Atlanta project used bodily practices of figurative violence to associate black bodies in public with the black Muslims and global colonial subjects. For example, they organized a picket line to protest the drafting of black men for the Vietnam War. They picketed outside of the Industrial Center building in Atlanta, which housed the army recruiting headquarters. The picket line was composed of all women, who dressed in "long
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

black dresses", and were "heavily veiled."113 They carried picket signs depicting a 1919 lynch scene with text that read, "Did the Vietcong do this", and another sign that read "The Vietcong Never Called me Nigger".114 These signs contrasted to typical signs carried by the rights project that contained text signifying 'love' and 'justice'.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Rather than practice self-restraint and affective self-mastery, the Atlanta Project tried to intimidate the police to replace the 'real' outrage to police brutality. As the emotions and violence of one anti-draft protest began to escalate after army personnel grabbed and lifted up a black female protesters, black men responded by 'defending' the black women, ordering the army personnel to "take their hands off the black women or there would be trouble."115 The officer in charge of the army and ordered his men to take their hands off the women. Furthermore, the Atlanta Project members used rhetorical practices to define blacks associated with the government as race traitors. At a rally to free imprisoned Atlanta Project activists, Bill Ware used discourses of black authenticity to distinguish black cops from real blacks. Ware told the crowd gathered on the street corner that "black cops represented the white power structure in the neighborhood" and that black cops "are white men with black

skins" and were enemy of real black people "as any white Klu-Klux Klansmen."116 The use of figurative violence induced affective responses like anger that Ware hoped would mobilize the black community.   For the black nationalist project, overcoming black apathy was just as important as overcoming white oppression. Urban Revitalization
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
We can observe the differences between local and national organizing, civic practice and training programs in how the rights and black nationalist projects approached urban revitalization. For SNCC, urban revitalization became important because 1) the southern revitalization projects effect on the economy, political relations and built environment and 2) the increasing importance of the urban black subject, which began to replace the rural black subject as the representation of authentic blackness. Regarding southern revitalization, blacks were looking to be included in the federal subsidies, especially Johnson's War on Poverty programs. The south was in the midst of an economic boom received and a disproportionate amount of federal money for transportation, defense industries, and new technologies (Sale 1975). Indeed, SNCC based their 1965 boycott of the new Hammermill Paper factory in Selma on disrupting the new south revitalization project of producing a modern civic image. Based on the Hammermill Boycott, the Atlanta Project challenged the idea that Atlanta was the city 'too busy to hate', and noted that "Atlanta, as a city, is quite vulnerable and all of the myths about 'progressive Atlanta' can be destroyed with just the

              &lt;p&gt;
280
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
slightest bit of pressure."117 Second, the increasing visibility of the urban black subject resulted solely from the increased influence of the black nationalist project. As early as 1964, SNCC noticed that Harlem stores were full of products to treat the problems of cockroaches and rat bites.118 Based on his observations of Harlem's black political culture and visits with the Harlem group HARYOU, Bill Hall associated the idea of urban renewal with "Negro removal". He proposed that blacks wanted to remain in black communities, therefore, black urban renewal practice should be directed at improve existing black communities by tearing down the slums and replacing them with public housing, rather than move blacks to another part of the city.119
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The issue of urban revitalization became important to the rights project after they failed to organize the Chicago Movement around the very broad and abstract issue of 'ending slums'. Although the rights project identified problems specific to urban blacks, such as the breakup of the black family, overcrowded and substandard schools, refusal of hospital admission and bank loans, they settled on housing discrimination. In part, the focus on housing discrimination was due to the existing black civic organizations in Chicago already working on that problem. However, housing discrimination fit the pattern and strategy of associating idealized citizenship and deracializing practices with a political issue. Housing discrimination was wrong because it denied good blacks who deserved and   could   afford   better   housing   the   opportunity   to   better   themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;

281
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Furthermore, the main issue in the 1966 Civil Rights Bill was open housing and housing discrimination, which Johnson eventually signed into law in the 1968 Civil Rights Act. In contrast to the black nationalist project, the rights projects focus on the idea of housing discrimination did not tackle the issues of how to govern and 'care' for the black neighborhood. The rights project focus of providing access for blacks to the more affluent neighborhoods represented the projects broader idea of civic integration.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The rights and black nationalist projects differed in how they approached the ghetto's physical environment. The physical environment is important to the process of urbanization because it is the point at which urban planners, residents, and existing meanings all converge to define new spatial-cultural meanings (see Lefebvre 1991, Gottdiener 1994). The black nationalist project sought immediate gains in the urban black community by focusing on the quality of the physical environment, and whose responsibility it was to maintain the property. Since blacks lived in slums controlled by white slumlords, the black nationalist project directed questions of how to improve the environment by enforcing existing housing codes and clearing slums in favor of public housing. The black nationalist project distinguished a body-environment relation experienced by urban blacks but not by urban whites. The most important point was the presence of rats and other disease-carrying varmint. An important authentic black practice was purifying the black body by limiting bodily mutilation. This included rat bites. The Atlanta project documented the conditions of the physical environment in the black ghettos, and Markum Street in particular:
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
282
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
"There are pockets of dilapidated, rodent infested unheated dwellings scattered throughout the predominant Negro area city. Here live people who are sapped up by parasitic slumlords, lying peddlers, cheating insurance men and election day only politicians."120 Thus, an important part of establishing the black nationalist project in an area was improving the immediate black neighborhood to show that they were capable of governing and organizing better than both the rights project and the white political infrastructure.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The rights project also identified the squalid living conditions of blacks living in American ghettos. Their approach to urban revitalization was similar to their approach to voting rights legislation, in that they did some local organizing, but the main emphasis was on getting the federal government to intervene. The Chicago movement organized some local protest practices, such as Bernard Lafayette's youth program to demonstrate the danger of lead paint and lead poisoning to the city (Ralph 1993: 48). Nevertheless, the Chicago Movement preferred civic practices that raised national awareness about the plight of blacks living in American Ghettos and Federal support for new housing. Similar to his practice of going to jail to bring media attention to the Birmingham and Selma movements, King moved his family to the North Lawndale section of Chicago, into a building Corretta Scott King described as dirty and smelling of urine. Because of the buildings poor condition, King and other members of the Chicago Movement took 'trusteeship' of the building. They dressed themselves in work clothes, grabbed shovels and brooms and began cleaning up the building. They also used a 'mild' rent strike, and withheld rent until the landlord agreed to fix the 120 MS - "Untitled/No Author - Atlanta Project Draft for housing Project"
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
283
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
building. Ralph (1993) noted that these attempts failed because the slumlord was an 80-year-old man who did not conform to an idea of a greedy and overzealous slumlord, and that the Chicago Project did not comprehend the realities that many of the ghetto slumlords were also black. In addition, King only 'lived' in Chicago Wednesday thru Saturday, so this protest practice appeared somewhat disingenuous to Chicago activists.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Therefore, instead of focusing on specific slumlord practices, the rights project focused on the system of economic exploitation that allowed slumlords to control black urban areas. The Chicago Movement organized the East Garfield Park Union to End Slums (EGPUES). They called upon two slumlords, who owned over 30 apartment buildings, to attend a mass meeting with ghetto residents. The slumlords fielded questions from audience members, and rather than change, the slumlords assigned blame to the bankers and mortgage lenders who would not lend them the economic capital to fix up the homes. When the audience's affective responses transformed into personal attacks on the slumlords, King reminded that audience that the system was on trial, not the two slumlords. After a picketing and a performing a rent strike, the slumlords and renters negotiated a deal, the 'Condor and Costalis Agreement', which limited the amount of control landlords have over property, and bestowed some property rights to tenants (see Ralph 1993: 64). The collective bargaining agreement changed the relations between landlords and renters, and each of their relations with the property. Slumlords were required to perform prompt and routine maintenance on the buildings.   Residents were required to follow specific rules
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
284
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
governing "tenant behavior". We can see how the collective bargaining agreement shared responsibility between tenant-slumlord represented the rights projects emphasis on mastering personal ethical practices, and why they trained southern blacks on domestic housekeeping practices. For the rights project, being good tenants equated to other good black ethical practices. Good tenants were neat, organized, and paid their bills in a timely manner. Consequently, good tenants deserved good housing, and it was the obligation of slumlords to provide good housing. Thus, the rights project attached the idea of good black citizenship to black economic rights (property rights) in Chicago.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
In contrast to how the rights project directed their civic practices at cultural norms and national centers of power, the Atlanta project drew from the black nationalist approach that sought specific places and individuals to protest. The Atlanta Projects' solutions to fixing the urban environment were not to devise a system of shared and reciprocal responsibility for the maintenance and upkeep of the homes without black ownership. The Atlanta's project solution differed in three ways. First, they selected the black section of Markham Street and the Vine City neighborhood. Vince City was the 'known' part of Atlanta that represented some of the worst housing conditions in the city. Indeed, even SCLC leaders King and Abernathy noted how Markham Street was some of the "worst conditions ever seen."121 Rather than wage an abstract fight against 'poverty' or 'housing conditions', the Atlanta project outlined specific slumlord practices, 'named names' and sought to confront specific landlords. The handwritten flyer announcing the start of a picket line, titled "Slumlords Must Go", 121 MS "Some Proposals for a Housing Campaign
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
285
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
noted that the picket line was to stop evictions, raggedy houses, no gas, no hot
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
water,   high   rents,   rats  and   roaches,   no  lights,   no  bathroom."122     They
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
concentrated their efforts at a single slumlord named Joe Shaffer.   The Atlanta
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Project noted that Shaffer made
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
exorbitant profits by renting a house with five or six rooms to three, four and even five families and collecting $20 to $40 a month from each", and "has established a plantation-like system in which he acts as landlord, employer, grocer, creditor, sheriff, judge and jury over the people who live on his property. He cashes their welfare checks, controls their credit123
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Because of the practice of specific slumlords regulating most, if not all of black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
economic relations in Atlanta, The Atlanta Project sought to eliminate specific
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
slumlords, which they felt would have a ripple effect throughout the city.   They
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
defined slumlords, along with police and social workers, as specific whites who
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
prevented blacks from having intact nuclear heteronormative families and from
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
governing their own communities.   The Atlanta Project perceived, correctly or
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
not, slumlords as powerful political figures networked with other powerful whites.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Rather than cave in, Shaffer choose to demolish one house at 444 Markham
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Street rather than make improvements to the building.124  Nevertheless, specific
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
slumlords provided a point of resistance and direct link to local power centers.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Second, the Atlanta Project wanted the city of Atlanta to enforce the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
existing housing codes.125 The Atlanta project designed a rough "Tenements
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
every house, and the connections between individual landlords and whites who

286
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
run the government.126 Since landlords owned the property, and used it to produce income and wealth, the Atlanta project argued that it was the landlords responsibility to ensure their property was suitable for living. Their logic followed the black nationalist project of not blaming the blacks for hardships imposed on them because of whites. While the black nationalist project was concerned about drug addiction and family breakups, for instance, they isolated hegemonic white culture as the problem. This contrasted sharply to how the rights project negotiated a deal that shared responsibility for the upkeep on the property. Whites burdened the responsibility for the maintenance of white owned buildings, not blacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The third difference between the two projects was how the black nationalist project used revolutionary practices of forming tent cities rather than negotiate a compromise with landlords. While both the Atlanta Project and the Chicago Movement used rent strikes, they used them to achieve different goals. The Chicago Movement used a rent strike to force real estate agents to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement. It represented their strategy to force negotiations that deracialized social and political relationship. The Atlanta Project, in contrast used rent strikes to make land claims. The idea of owning territory represented revolutionary practice of owning land. Historically, land ownership and territorial claims have been markers of independence, legitimacy and domination127. The Atlanta project drew from the 'tent city model' that blacks

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
127  As noted in chapter 4, the Nation of Islam demanded land reparations, not financial ones, because the idea of owing land distinguished them as legit. Although the black nationalist project backed   away   from   demanding   land   claims,   and   more   recently   demanded   monetary

in Lowndes County, Alabama erected. In Lowndes County, blacks constructed tent cities to protest how white landlords evicted over forty black sharecropper families in December 1965, after blacks began to register to vote.128 The LCFO organized the tent cities similar to way separatist compounds associated with religious sects do. SNCC reported, "Each tent has two beds, a fire to of some sort, and a gun."129 For storage, the families used trunks, which they kept under the beds. Blacks in Greene County, Alabama also erected a tent city on March 1966, comprised of five tents housing two families, where the LCFO held political workshops.130 While the Atlanta Project used the urban black subject as the representation of authentic blackness, the LCFO used the rural black subject as the dominant form of black authenticity, and organized subsequent practices around what was best for rural black farmers. The LCFO attempted to organize a "Poor Peoples Land Corporation", a project designed to buy 400 acres of land to be broken into 20 acre plots, and establish grocery and clothing co-opts.131 Whites burned down the Greene County tent city on 3 October 1966. Based on the tent city models in Lowndes and Greene County, the Atlanta Project set up a tent city, the first tent city practiced in a large urban area, in a vacant lot on Markham Street to protest the eviction of a black family for refusing to pay rent
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
compensation, they continued to establish black business and housing ownership as practice of controlling and managing black neighborhoods.

until the landlord finished the proper upkeep on the building.132 The use of tent cities was not just a claim for better housing, but a revolutionary practice that marked public space for blacks. This practice combined the idea of black authenticity with territorial claims and separation from the white economic domination. It represented an idea of black sovereignty, in that blacks did not have to rely on whites for economic security or housing, and that blacks were capable of governing an all black community. FROM A CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT TO IDENTITY POLITICS
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
No single cause ended the civil rights movement. Indeed, scholars have traced the many reasons that prevented the movement from achieving additional rights and why the movement ended (see Blumberg 1984, Haines 1984, Garrow 1986, Eyerman and Jamison 1991, Carson 1994, McAdam 1998).133 Yet, the many explanatory models center on two related themes. One explanatory theme credits the changing relationship between the movement and the state. Because of movement's anti-Vietnam war stance, and the antiwar movement in general, the state increased the quantity and quality of its police surveillance, and decreased working relations on passing subsequent civil rights legislation. Additionally, Democrats seeking to offset the number of white voters deflecting to the Republican Party, which made Nixon's "southern strategy" and dreams of a permanent republican majority based on a neo-conservative-religious right political alliance possible, devalued the southern black vote. The second theme credits the fragmentation of movement,  including the disintegration of the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
132 SAV 46 "News of the Field #5" 23 March 1966"
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
133 Also see chapter 1 for an analysis on how the movement's decline is based on each conceptual model that led to the rise/birth of the civil rights movement.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
289
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
movements unified collective identity and the inability of various groups to work together. Thus, rather than review the already exhaustive explanations on why the movement declined, I will focus on how each of the political projects struggled over the question of the racial authenticity and the black political self. That is, while the movement ended, the political projects and their normative ideals of what counts as black citizenship continued, as did differences in the political level - national versus local geopolitical culture - that each normative ideal remained politically effective.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The question of the authentic black self was the question the black nationalist project introduced to the civil rights movement to reject deracializing strategies and any practice or process associated with whiteness. Although the rights project dominated civil rights discourse, primarily by incorporating the juridical and grassroots projects under a single discursive umbrella, they never dealt with the good black/ bad black normative distinction. In essence, the black nationalist project forced the rights project to answer how a black civil rights movement could represent blacks in the public sphere when they willingly excluded the majority of blacks that did not conform to idealized good black citizenship. Although the rights project continued to use discourses of good black citizenship to insist that race is not a determinate of good citizenship, they still needed a black political base to push for anti-poverty legislation. Thus, while the movement declined, it left us with a legacy of competing and irreducible normative ideals that remain implicit and underlie contemporary black political representations.

Black Authenticity and Decline of the Atlanta Project
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The question of the authentic black political agent changed, and then shattered SNCC's civic practices. Indeed, who and what counted as authentically black became an internal point of contestation that SNCC activists drew from to solve seemingly minor squabbles between SNCC activists. The Atlanta project used discourses of black authenticity to outline ethical practices that established limits of who and what qualified as acceptable black practice. The ethical practices included both a rhetoric and set of bodily practices that defined what counted as an authentic black political agent. The idea that every practice was subject to evaluation in relation to idealized blackness created boundaries within SNCC. SNCC activists erected boundaries between the semi-autonomous politic cells and SNCC's central committee, as well as within SNCC's central committee. The transformation of an issue over a missing car into a discursive struggle over who represented the black nationalist project led to the dissolution of the Atlanta project. In 1966, SNCC central committee inquired about missing money and a missing 1965 Dodge Dart assigned to the Atlanta Project. SNCC member Cleveland Sellers used discourses of black authenticity to describe the act of a black man stealing from a black organization as "be the most unwarranted act any true brother could commit. With this, and this alone, one could questions where your loyalties and sincerities were"134 At first, Ware responded to Sellers claims that he (Ware) was not a 'true brother' by indicating that Sellers was overreacting because of a "personal hang  up"

Disagreements amongst political activists are inevitable.  Even when they

              &lt;p&gt;
share common goals and ideologies, they ultimately will differ on the style and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
maintained working relations. What was new about the Atlanta Project's demise
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
is that the Atlanta Project and SNCC central committee both identified with the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black nationalist project and both used discourses of black authenticity to define
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
the political rhetoric and practice used to struggle against whites.  However, the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
idea of evaluating and ranking practices and people according to an arbitrary
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
idea of black authenticity dominated discussions and forms of disagreement. To

              &lt;p&gt;
be sure, the mounting frustrations and lack of political gains contributed to this.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
However, the civil rights movement as a whole went through extended periods
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
without winning new rights, and SNCC had many setbacks in Mississippi and

Arkansas without having political cells disintegrate. What is distinctive is they ranked blacks in relation to ideas of black authenticity rather than on political organizing skills and efforts to determine leadership and strategy. That is, authentic blackness became the only marker of legitimacy. The Atlanta project declined from within because black leaders had to master authentic black ethical practices, which did not always equate to smart and effective political strategy. Global Nomads and the American Black Community
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The question of black authenticity further crippled SNCC's central committee. SNCC's central committee, especially under the leadership of H Rap Brown, used discourses of black authenticity to attach ideas of whiteness and black 'race traitors' to geopolitical divisions, ultimately severing SNCC from the American black community. Although SNCC attempted to associated blacks with a world colonial struggle, and organized programs around a black colonial subject, blacks defined themselves as American citizens and no longer viewed SNCC as a serious or practical civil rights group. After the dissolution of LCFO, Atlanta Project, and the Mississippi based MFDP separation from the central committee based on their continued geographical and interracial focus, SNCC followed in Malcolm's OAAU model and situated their focus on global struggles. SNCC used discourses of black authenticity to define their shift from a nation-state based social movement to a global movement in terms of the east/west dichotomy. Since SNCC attached whiteness with anything associated with the west, including nation-states and capitalism, they associated themselves with the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
293
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
African, Asian, and Latin American postcolonial struggles.136 This had a number of effects on SNCC's final attempted programs. SNCC became sanctioned as a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) rather than a civil rights organization.137 They declared that they would practice as a human rights organization against colonialism, that they would strengthen their opposition to the Vietnam War with draft resistance, and planned to aid in the industrial development of Africa.138 They also increased their focus on black separation practices. Modeled after the Freedom Summer, LCFO and Atlanta Project movement programs, SNCC planned a "Peoples Sewing Center" to "to stimulate politicize, and channel all lasting energies of welfare mothers, black workers, [into a] viable revolutionary-conscious cadre".139 They also suggested an "Agrarian Reform Program" to unite black sharecroppers and tenant farmers in order to establish a common means of production, land purchases, and political education classes.140 Finally, they proposed a "People's Medical Center" to provide free health care to poor black people, and would form an all black political party to protect blacks from

A good source on the relationship between African movements and the civil rights movement is Meriwether (2002) Proudly We Can Be Africans. In addition to drawing from and supporting African post-colonial struggles, SNCC supported the Puerto Rican Movimiento Pro Independencia (MPI) based on the idea that they shared a common struggle. SAV 46 "Speech delivered by Stokely Carmichael, SNCC Chairman, before student body at the university of Puerto Rico" and SAV 46 "Joint statement of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the movement for Puerto Rico Independence (Movimiento Pro Independencia MPI.) Additionally, H. Rap Brown associated whiteness (the man) with capitalism "It's unreal to talk about black people controlling their communities unless they control the whole country. As long as the man controls the water or electricity coming into your community in a capitalist way, like the man, is not desirable. I think the real issue goes way beyond this idea of geographical control" (SAV 47-12 "Interview of Brown by Robert Allen of the Guardian"

political oppression by providing 'survival practices' like "political education, the marital arts, food, clothing, shelter and ultimately revolution."141
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Outside of the formality of operating with NGO status, SNCC never again managed to organize or implement any political program into practice after the dissolution of the Atlanta Project. SNCC completely broke from their grassroots past and used the idea of black authenticity to attach SNCC as part the white/nonwhite global and post-colonial struggles. They no longer organized movement programs around idealized black rural or urban subjects. Instead, the black colonial subject became the new authentic black political agent. Designing programs to provide free health care and survival practices when faced with severe military-political repression did not resonate with American black audiences. While American blacks were aware and supportive of the plight of Africans, and vice versa, American blacks were still American citizens, with new political rights and immediate concerns about economic discrimination, voter oppression and urban decay/revitalization projects. Furthermore, within a global framework and world capitalist system, SNCC could not bypass the nation-state to appeal to other supranational organizations like the UN. The power of the UN to intervene rests on the shoulders of its most powerful nation state members -especially the United States. Although SNCC, just like Malcolm, appealed to African nations for international support, African nations were still learning how to govern their own populations and how to negotiate their position in the Cold War.

Multiculturalism and Racial Authenticity: The Rights Project and Identity Politics
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The rights project maintained their dominance over the civil rights movement because of their symbolic citizenship claims that stressed national integration and their ability to incorporate the juridical and grassroots political projects under a discursive umbrella of good black citizenship. Until the black nationalist challenge, especially the idea that blacks should organize around an idealized revolutionary political agent, the rights project did not have to answer questions about the good black/ bad black binary. That is, no one publicly challenged the deracializing strategy. Noting that black power was a "slogan without a program", King attempted to emphasize the idea that blacks could still master techniques of deracialized self without negating blackness or a black political identity, and even suggest replacing the slogan 'black power' with 'black consciousness' (King 1968: 18, 31). Thus, in an attempt to argue that the good black/ bad black distinction was 'not anti-black', we can identify three themes in King's later text. 1) Civic diversity allowed blackness to flourish more than cultural singularities. 2) Deracialized and integration practices provided more opportunities to obtain power than racial authenticity and separation practices. 3) The black nationalist authentic black revolutionary agent reflected whiteness based on the bad black and bad white's shared use of violence to obtain power.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
First, King argued that the rights project and deracializing strategies promoted  an  idea of civic diversity,  whereas the black nationalist project
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
296
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
produced  homogenous  "cultural  singularities".     I  use the  concept cultural
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
singularities to refer to a set dogma-like political practices that seeks to cleanse
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
internal differences while rejecting external associational practices. For the rights
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
project, we get a sense that the black nationalist authoritative claims to represent
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
blackness became the point the rights project would have to overcome if it were
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
to continue its political influence. The rights project colonized the idea of 'black is
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
beautiful' by attaching the idea of the pre-discursive and 'natural' black body with
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
deracialized personal ethical practices,
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Our children must be taught to stand tall with their heads proudly lifted. We need not be duped into purchasing bleaching creams that promise to make us lighter. We need not process our hair to make it appear straight. Whether some men, black and white, realize it or not, black people are very beautiful... The Negro, through self-acceptance and self-appreciation, will one day cause white America to see that integration is not an obstacle, but an opportunity to participate in the beauty of diversity (King 1968: 123).
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Influenced in part by the black nationalist rejection of black body mutilation, the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
rights project argued that blacks should master personal body ethical practices
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
that projected a more natural black appearance.  Good black citizens mastered
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
bodily posture, but they did not have to straighten their hair or even out their skin
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
tone.  A neat, but not fake, black appearance produced a new idea of the black
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
self, which could only help the process of racial integration rather than promote
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
racial separation. Second, the practical danger of cultural singularities was that it
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
organized irrational civic practices by depriving blacks of their 'free will' to choose
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
among the best alternatives. King argued that organizing political support around
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
black candidates based on skin color rather than a candidate's political platform
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
was irresponsible and  reckless,  and emphasized that "The basic thing  in
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
297
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
determining the best candidate is not his color but his integrity" (King 1968: 49). The danger of producing a cultural singularity was that blacks could be controlled by unscrupulous black leaders, similar to the 'Uncle Toms' who sold out the black community for their own personal gain, which placed blacks in the same or worse situation that they found themselves in. In contrast, civic diversity, including racial and economic diversity, as well as multiple public spheres, provided blacks will more choices and opportunities for success.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Second, the rights project rejected the notion that civic integration and obtaining power were discursive and strategic antimonies. The idea behind integration, King argued was power: "Integration is meaningless without the sharing of power. When I speak of integration, I don't mean a romantic mixing of colors, I mean a real sharing of power and responsibility" (King [1969] 1986: 317). Mastering good black ethical practices was a more effective way to obtain power than by separating. It gave blacks access to better jobs and political positions they otherwise could not get. Indeed, the idea of sharing power with whites was even more preferable because it established a new political culture not based on racial domination or skin color as markers of distinction, but a political culture based on upholding shared values of good citizenship. Thus, a deracialized project that disassociated black stereotypes meant obtaining power while being a better black citizen, albeit a black citizen who continued to be culturally 'black'.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Finally, King argued that the black nationalist project reflected the type of violent civic practices associated with the same bad whites the rights project
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
298
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
sought to displace. In essence, King used the same rhetorical practice as the black nationalist project of associating whiteness with undesirable practices. He argued, "One of the greatest paradoxes of the black power movement is that it talks unceasingly about not imitating the values of white society, but in advocating violence it is imitating the worst, the most brutal and the most uncivilized values of American life" (King 1968: 64). The rights project's deracializing strategy was based on the good black/ bad white binary, which aligned good blacks and good whites with idealized American citizenship at the expense of bad whites and bad blacks. King saw the black nationalist project as legitimizing and cementing black stereotypes to black citizenship. Rather than producing a normative black political agent capable of displacing whites, the rights project viewed the black nationalist project as reproducing the undesirable qualities of bad whites. Since bad whites maintained their control over the south with anti-democratic and violent practices, the black nationalists, at best, could hope to secure very limited, and unstable, political rule over isolated black areas. The deracialized good black citizen was the preferable alternative that allowed blacks to keep a black identity and still be good American citizens.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
These three themes indicate how the rights project had to divert much of their resources and focus on maintaining their dominant position by fending off internal challenges to their idea that blacks should master deracialized techniques of self. They were trying to stake out a position that would satisfy their good white liberal allies, while preventing the spread of the black nationalist project to other parts of the south, and the increased fractioning of the movement
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
299
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
groups. The NAACP, Urban League, as well as influential figures like Rustin took out an ad in the New York Times denouncing black power. Rustin's refused to support a "Free DC Rally" because the DC committee would not include labor or religious groups.142 As noted above, SNCC refused to meet with the president or partake in SCLC's citizenship schools. Because they would not waver from their strategy to deracialize what counted as good American citizenship, since it had worked to produce the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Act, the rights and black nationalist project remained in a political standoff until the black nationalist groups dissipated. By the time the black nationalist groups were gone, the rights project had lost any momentum obtained by the legislation, as well a local political black bases that did not conform to their idea of good black citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Thus, the rights project's efforts to convince blacks that deracialized techniques of self did not equate to racial shame and black self-hate produced a style of political practice conducive to modern 'identity polities'. The idea behind identity politics was politically organizing around a shared ascribed status that served as a common point of oppression. As the woman's movement and queer movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s emerged onto the American civic scene, the political left was divided into fragmented political identity groups. Indeed, political coalitions between blacks and women, or blacks and gays, were harder to produce and maintain that coalitions between blacks and white labor groups. As the black nationalist groups drifted to the margins of the American political scene, primarily because they could not sustain their revolutionary programs, they left a practice of evaluating and interpreting black political

300
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
candidates based on how they reflected black practices. The rights project attempt to weaken the boundaries produced by the good black/bad black binary without abandoning their normative symbolic citizenship claims left them with the residue of the practice of evaluating black political practice based on degrees of black authenticity. In part, the increased focus on economic equality and urban revitalization brought on by the 1965 Voting Rights Act would have forced the rights project to confront the good black/bad black distinction. However, the problem of evaluating and distinguishing black political practice, which differed from questioning blacks political allegiances and self-interest practices, was something introduced by the black nationalist project.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Despite the rise of identity politics, the competing ideas of mastering a deracialized technique of self versus mastering authentic black techniques of self continued to be important and effective on different political levels. At the national and global level, black politicians practiced the techniques of a deracialized self, to appear racially non-threatening, in order to draw from the widest political base. In contrast, black political leaders at the local level, especially in mayoral and congressional races, practiced the techniques of authentic black self to appeal to local black communities. Because neighborhood segregation and gerrymandering political districts already separated black political communities from white ones, black candidates appealed to all black audiences, and mastering techniques of the authentic black self was more important for caring for the all black community. CONCLUSION
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
301
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
This chapter outlined how the civil rights movement changed American political culture, represented by the Voting Rights Act, and how that new political culture led to the hardening of boundaries between the rights and black nationalist project, as well as to the decline of the civil rights movement. The new political culture was the development of a new way to approach racial differences in the public sphere. For the rights project, the idea of the good black citizen became associated with the need for voter rights legislation, and became the dominant normative representation of the black political agent. For the state, the voting rights act changed their legal and juridical practices of excluding racial minorities, redrawing exclusionary boundaries based on the idea of good citizenship. The rights project normative idea of the deracialized good black citizen, coupled with change in governing practices, produced new political relations that paradoxically downplayed blackness while at the same time making the management of the black self the central ethical practice for black political agents. That is, if blacks were to partake in a civically integrated public life, they would have to master the bodily and affective practices that represented them as good black citizens. The spread of the new south revitalization project's practice of using suburbanization, surveillance and decreasing rural political influence prepared the south to adapt to the new rules of the game. Although the black nationalist project was nurtured in northern urban environments, like Harlem and Chicago that already dealt with subtle forms of segregation, their experimentations with revolutionary practices in Atlanta never spread to the larger black population. The 'deracializing' of the public sphere served to further
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
302
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
marginalize the black nationalist normative idea of the authentic black citizen because set against the idea of the good black citizen, authentic blackness became an endorsement of black stereotypes, which isolated the local activists from whites and the other black groups.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Further complicating matters for the movement was the spread of the old south project on the state level despite setbacks and losing to the movement. We saw city municipalities draw from the idea of the new south to shield them from old south state policies, and create political autonomy from the old south project, yet, the old south project became the dominant regional and statewide position. In essence, southern whites could have their cake and eat it too. Wallace drew from the old south project to issue corporate subsidies with public funds to relocate northern business while southern urban areas reproduced the new south lived environment that corporate executives favored. The south produced as a set of governing practices that improved the lives of southern whites, and some southern blacks, without having to grant racial equality. Thus, the working relations between the old and new south project changed the south in ways it divided blacks and whites territorially, as well as how they used the post-Voting Rights Act political culture. By the end of the 1960s, the south was quickly becoming political and economic power center in American politics. Subsequently, the concentration of cultural influence, political and economic power to the southern cities reproduced the same patterns of urban segregation and subtle forms of racism that dominated northern areas.  As long as the new
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
303
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
south did not engage good blacks with violence, they curtailed further protests for black equality.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Therefore, the post-Voting Rights political culture, which eliminated voting rights as a mobilizing issue, changed how the political projects approach racial equality. This chapter argued that the civil rights movements 'split' is better understood as the competing political projects differing strategies on how to politically organize blacks in the post-Voting Rights era. Using comparative methodology, I isolated four important differences in how each political projects symbolic citizenship claims organized black political practice to support this argument. First, the political projects differed in strategy of whether to pressure the nation or local government for continued reform. The rights projects' deracializing strategy attached the idea that good black citizens deserved fair and equable treatment that only the federal government could ensure. In contrast, the black nationalist project strategy of cleansing an all black political identity by organizing all black parties at the local level, attached the idea that real black citizens could govern and manage themselves, and did not need nor want the help of whites. The rights project view of the black vote as something blacks could use to integrate into the national polity because it transformed them into an asset, especially in the black belt and large urban cities. Rather than integrate into the national polity, the black nationalist project sought to form local all black political parties to gain control over black neighborhoods, win local city and state seats, and then negotiate and play politics with whites.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
304
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The second difference was how each political project organized movement programs and 'measured' black citizenship. The rights project used the voter registration exams as a recruiting tool to improve the qualitative level of black citizenship. Without this recruitment issue, the citizenship schools became a way to train black activists how to canvass for new voters without having to master personal and social ethical practices that represented good black citizens. Thus, the citizenship schools reverted to quantitatively measuring the number of black voters, and could no longer discipline black agents to be good black citizens. In contrast, the black nationalist project used tutoring and community center programs to measure black citizens based on the arbitrary ideal of authentic blackness. They emphasized black history, as well as domestic practices to enforce boundaries between black men and black women, but also to establish the sovereignty of black communities. With the right to vote secured, the black nationalist project decreased the importance of voting in favor of racially purifying the black community.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The third difference is how each political project approached civic ethical practices. The rights culture continued to use rhetorical practices of disassociating black stereotypes from black citizen, and held workshops on how to master the bodily postures and affective responses necessary to practice nonviolence and represent good black citizenship. However, the rights project sought to use the idea of good citizenship to produce and sustain political coalitions. Based on their larger strategy of pressuring the national government for reform, the rights project hoped to build a national 'left coalition', primarily of
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
305
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
labor and racial groups, to make the claim that they were good citizens who deserved minimal levels of social guarantees, as part of being a good American citizen. In contrast, the black nationalist project used figurative violence to intimidate whites into respecting existing black citizenship rights, and emphasized the importance of black leaders in the maintenance of all-black organizations and communities. Whereas the rights project saw black civic practice as part of a larger whole (or civil society), the black nationalist project defined black civic practice as a self-contained unit, used to produce black cultural and political sovereignty rather than racial and civic integration. Based on their local strategy, SNCC's black nationalist political cells emphasized black leaders mastering personal ethical practices that represented them as role models for other black political agents to draw from so they could govern black communities.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The post-Voting Rights Act political culture's final affect on the movement was how it structured the question of what to do next. Both political projects struggled for economic rights by fighting for, and against, urban revitalization. The rights project sought to make urban black poverty visible to the larger nation, especially whites, by having King move into the ghetto, organizing marches through white neighborhoods, and establishing a system reciprocal responsibility between black tenants and landlords that protected blacks from rental abuse as long as blacks mastered good tenant practices. They also struggled against urban revitalization, specifically white flight associated with suburbanization, by fighting for the rights of good black citizens (who could afford it) to move into
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
306
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
wealthier white neighborhoods. In contrast to the rights projects' concern with integrating wealthy white neighborhoods and sharing responsibility for white owned property, the Atlanta Project represented how the black nationalist project struggled for urban revitalization by focusing on the improvement and care of black neighborhoods. They pressured the city of Atlanta to enforce existing building codes, and targeted specific slumlords that had extraordinary amount of control over black neighborhoods. This differed from how the Chicago Movement targeted the abstract system of economic inequality, and sought cooperation between tenants and landlords. The two projects also differed in how they used similar civic practices. Whereas the rights project use of rent strikes led to negotiations, the Atlanta Projects use of rent strikes led to the formation of tent cities. For the rights project, rent strikes was a way to establish blacks desire to integrate only into a just society, where the black nationalist project used rent strikes to represent black desire for cultural and political independence from whites.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
This chapter also allows us to rethink the relationship between ideas (or political ideology) and social movements. Based on my conceptual framework, I proposed we understand the political project separately from the social movement. My use of concept "political project" referred to the normative ideas, discourses, practices, and forms of knowledge produced by historically embedded political ideas of how political life should be, and how it should operate. In contrast, I defined "social movements" as a collection of heterogeneous political agents temporarily bounded together by the political
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
307
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
projects normative ideas, especially citizenship. By separating the two concepts, we can understand first, why the movement declined, and second, the legacy of each political project's normative ideas of black citizenship. The black nationalist project declined because of the idea of authentic blackness became the dominant form of political legitimation among supporters, which produced black infighting and limited forms of political strategy that could not navigate blacks in the changing political culture. In contrast, the rights project declined because they lacked a local based to compliment their national strategy, their inability to resolve the tension between their normative claims good black/bad black citizenship, and their failure to adapt and expand their civic practices in the changing political culture. In part, the rights project were the victims of their own success. Although the rights project was and remained the dominant position in the civil rights movement, their idea of good black citizenship excluded too many blacks historically confined to margins because rural poverty and white domination. Although the movement declined, the political projects left a legacy for subsequent generations of black political agents. Contemporary representations of black citizenship reflect the rights project deracialized good black citizen and support of universal good citizenship. On the one hand, good black citizens have been celebrated by larger civic culture as blacks who deserve rights, good housing, good jobs - that the system works for those who can master a set of ethical practices representing good citizenship. On the other hand, bad black citizens are anchored to margins and made invisible by a culture
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
308
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
that legitimates their hardships and destitute situations as evidence of blacks choosing an authentic black culture rather than a good Americans one.
&lt;/p&gt;

"The good and just society is neither the thesis of capitalism nor the antithesis of Communism, but a socially conscious democracy which reconciles the truths of individualism and collectivism."

              &lt;p&gt;
based  on  citizens mastering  a set of ethical  practices,  sought to critique

              &lt;p&gt;
to produce a new black political agent that reflected the idealized good American

&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
of the good black citizen was the dominate representation attached to that act. It

&lt;/p&gt;

gain influence, as they rejected the rights projects deracializing strategy in favor of producing an authentic black revolutionary political agent.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
For black America, some unintended consequences accompanied The Voting Rights Act, which shaped American politics for 40 years. In his 1968 book, Where Do We Go from Here, King noted that the year after Selma "the white backlash had become an emotional electoral issue in California, Maryland and elsewhere. In several Southern states men long regarded as political clowns had become governors or only narrowly missed election their magic achieved with a witches' brew of bigotry, prejudice, half-truths and whole lies" (King 1968: 2). In 1967, Ronald Reagan was among the many political clowns to become governor. In 1980, he declared his presidential campaign in Philadelphia, Mississippi, where three civil rights activists were murdered, with a nod to "states rights", and in 1983 declared the Voting Rights Act was an insult to the south. Although the Voting Rights Act made democratic citizenship more fair, its legacy included a unifying point for bad whites and their practice of old south patronage and racism to ascend to the national level. Despite the rhetoric of states rights, religious values and anti-intellectual discourses, the defection of southern whites from the Democratic to the Republican Party centered on the Republican objection to racial integration, the 1964 Civil Rights and 1965 Voting Rights Act.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Throughout this dissertation, I have attempted to shed light on the importance of how the civil rights movement drew from various political projects, and how they used discourses to organize the pedagogical practice of their various programs.   I also attempted to show the history of how and why they
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
311
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
constructed these programs in relation to the sociological importance of ethics, the body, good citizenship, and racial authenticity. The rights project used discourse of good citizenship to produce a deracialized good black citizen that reflected universal claims of good citizenship. The deracializing strategy made it possible to question and delegitimate associations of race, and specifically whiteness, with good citizenship. The rights project produced good black citizens by situating their pedagogical techniques in discourses of good black citizenship to shape bodily postures and teach affective self-management to shape bodily representations of good black citizenship. Although the citizenship schools, role-playing, community centers and grassroots leadership training attempted to teach lessons on voter canvassing, how to pass literacy tests, how to navigate unfamiliar black communities and healthy dietary practices, they instructed a set of ethical practices embedded in the practical lessons. Although the black nationalist project used competing discourses of black authenticity to construct black political agents capable of governing autonomous black communities, they also instructed ethical practices of how to preserver the natural black body and use affective response to intimidate and ward off whites. These ethical practices set the limits within a political context of how one should act, via rhetoric and practice, which limits/defines/stabilizes the unitary good black political agent. Therefore, ethics ties together, through discourse, emotions and cognition through the body, by emphasizing the historical situatedness of the social movement and political agent.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
312
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
We have to understand this struggle between the rights project and the black nationalist project as competing leftist political projects struggling to represent the black political left. They both rejected the Uncle Tom political representation individual blacks benefiting from the continued exploitation of the black community. The Uncle Tom did not always appear in a suit and tie, telling the black community to be patient. In Birmingham, Bull Connor's main source within the black community was a downtown pimp and drug dealer. Robert Williams noted that the Uncle Tom appeared rolling through town in a Cadillac handing out money to blacks to stay uninvolved and remain subservient to local whites (Williams [1962] 1968). Civil rights groups drew from competing political projects to construct normative ideas of good black citizens and authentic black citizens to replace the existing representations of the Uncle Tom and docile, apolitical black. The key was not converting Uncle Toms, although the movement as a whole did pressure them into supporting the black struggle, but targeting the apolitical black population and bringing them into the civic sphere.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Concerning civil rights historiography, I have contributed to the importance of the movement programs, the transformation of SNCC into a black nationalist group, and post-Voting right SNCC practice. As mentioned in chapters one and three, civil rights movement scholars have glossed over the movement programs in favor of research questions pertaining to the formal organization of each group. Drawing from insights in cultural sociology, I have shown that the various movement programs were vital for the civil rights movement, as whole, success. As the movements' programs waned after the 1965 Voting Rights Act, so the
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
313
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
movement. Secondly, I have shown the importance of how SNCC used discourses of black authenticity to re-organize their grassroots project. By distinguishing SNCC's grassroots project from SCLC's rights project, I argued that SNCC's attempts to organize inter-racially, based on shared local geopolitical culture, provided the foundation for SNCC activists to use discourses of black authenticity to re-organize local black populations around normative ideas of the racially pure black political agent without the pressures of national and universal citizenship. This explains a key aspect missing in social movement theories that cannot be explain by structural shifts, race-class intersection, or organizational models: that SNCC's transformation into a black nationalist group was made in relation to spatial organizing practices and role of discourse. Finally, in contrast to SNCC scholars which saw the lack of instrumental gains as equating to a general failure of and rapid disintegration of the Atlanta Project, I have shown that they did indeed organize a black nationalist challenge to the city of Atlanta, and impacted black urban culture. Although the Atlanta Project did not win any rights, they did change how urban blacks perceived slumlords, disparities in incarceration, and their relations with the national rights project.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Just as the legacy of the Voting Rights Act continued many years after its passage, the competing political projects remain influential long after the decline of the civil rights movement. The rights and black nationalist projects have continue to shape contemporary representations of black citizenship. At the time of writing this dissertation in 2007, we see influential black figures, such as Bill Cosby,  draw from  the  rights  project's  idea  of mastering  personal  ethical
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
314
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
practices, especially manners of speech and dress, as the basis for civic integration and the reasons why black urban youth cannot succeed scholastically and economically. The PBS program, Tavis Smiley Show, debated the merits and legacy of Clarence Thomas's memoir, My Grandfather's Son. Thomas represents the black political agent both the rights and black nationalist project sought to avoid: the Uncle Tom who personally gained at the expense of other blacks, as indicated by Thomas's rejection of continuing to base school affirmative action and funding by race. During the program, Cornell West questioned why the media used Al Sharpton, who reflects many of the bad black stereotypes in rhetoric, ethical practices (mannerisms) and bodily postures (style of dress) rather than black intellectuals who opposed Thomas on ideological and juridical terms, noting that Sharpton represented just "one particular moment of Black people expressing their critique."
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
The question that dominates discussion of the black nationalist project is its legacy. What happened to it? Where did it go? The short answer, albeit the insufficient and wrong answer, was that the black nationalist project declined in relation to increased state and FBI surveillance, and the urban based black nationalist groups, like Oakland's Black Panthers, Chicago's Blackstone Rangers, or Philadelphia's famed Black Mafia, which used their organizational structure to enter the drug trade in the 1970s and 80s. Although specific black nationalist groups have come and gone, we see the legacy of the black nationalist project in cultural genres, such as academic circles and hip hop culture. Black intellectuals, such as Michael Eric Dyson and bell hooks, continue
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
315
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
to question and warn of the dangers of championing the implicit idea of good black citizenship the marker for racial equality, in light of high number of black school dropouts, divorce and incarceration rates, as well as pressuring the state to enforce existing citizenship rights. Although they black academics have sought to cleanse black nationalist of its sexist and homophobic practices, they have maintained the approach that society is ordered first on racial lines, and that black equality must be sought by solving internal 'differences' so that blacks may proceed as a group. In contrast to academic genres, blacks on the left and right have vilified hip hop cultures for exhibiting and championing many of the black stereotypes they fought against. A sub genre of hip hop artists have drawn from the black nationalist project to produce racially conscious lyrics that represent the plight of urban blacks. However, hip hop culture's inability to distance themselves from the hyper-sexualized and violent subject matter has associated the hip hop groups, from 1980s hip hop pioneers Public Enemy to contemporary groups like Dead Prez, with the more orthodox black nationalism of the 1960s. Thus, rather than a single black nationalist project, we generally see two forms of black nationalism based in different genres and social positioning of the actors. However, it should be noted that black nationalism in general remains firmly anchored at the political margins, providing the minority voice and challenge to the rights project influence over national black political matters.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Based on my theoretical approach that draws from approaches in cultural sociology that emphasizes the role of culture and power, and then applies them
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
316
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
to issues not readily addressed in the cultural genre, future research in social movements and political sociology should consider the following four ideas: 1. The importance of citizenship, specifically ideas of good citizenship, in relation to how political groups and social movements organize their strategies and produce normative ideals of political agents. Understandings of citizenship can vary. Social movements and political groups operating on the national scale, within the dominant public sphere, will most likely draw from and challenge universal claims of good citizenship. In contrast, social movements and political groups on the margins will most likely draw from multicultural, or even multinational, claims of citizenship, where by citizenship is perceived to be the property of groups. This has implications, especially on the margins, with our understanding of why groups organize and proceed as "groups" or "individuals" as they either challenge or attempt to enact civil reform. The extent that democracy can function or that civil society remains vibrant and stable will depend on how groups begin to transfer their self attachments from ascribed groups to a national civic identification with minimal exclusionary criteria. Future research should consider not only how we can reduce exclusionary criteria, but also question the very basis the idea of a single representation of good citizenship that influences how we govern ourselves. The development of cosmopolitan cultures in lieu of new forms of globalization may depend on the relation/tension between civic and group identification.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
317
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
2.   How social movements and political groups create the representations of the populations they claim only to represent. Social movements produce normative ideas as they make claims for civil inclusion or revolution. Social movement practices are not neutral bearers or transmitters of meaning143. I have used the concept of "symbolic citizenship" to refer to how groups create the normative ideas of good citizenship in relation to the dominant civic culture idealized citizen. I showed how the civil rights movement did not frame themselves as good democratic citizens or good Christians. Rather, groups, like SCLC, drew from the rights project to produced deracialized techniques of self that represented blacks as idealized citizens in relation to their constructs of bad white citizenship. Therefore, subsequent social movement research should follow the cultural turn in social movement theory, reject frame analysis, and consider how movement produce new identities, form of practices, and normative ideas of political agents, and how this varies between contrasting, and sometimes overlapping, political projects.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
3.   The distinction between political projects and social movements. I distinguished the social movement as the manifestation of the historically situated political projects. Social movements draw from ideas, discourses and narratives that organize political projects. This is important for subsequent research in political sociology and social movements because is allows us to analyze how 1) all actors in civil society, including advocacy groups and lobbyists, and draw from historically embedded projects and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Also see Steinberg 1998 on how the framing perspective is a based on a referential use of language
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
318
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
use specific discourses to make claims for rights, reform and civic inclusion. Although research notes the distinction of social movements and voluntary associations from advocacy groups, distinguishing the type of political project, and how the various groups use it, allows for a more nuance understandings of their points of difference and convergence. 2) It broadens our understanding of the cultural basis for state practices. Although the state and civil society are autonomous spheres, reciprocity exists between them. Social actors draw from various political projects to gain control over the state based on normative ideals of the 'good life' and the 'good community. In turn, these projects influence administrative and governing practices. Further research in political sociology and the governmentality genres would benefit by indicating the importance of normative political cultures in organizing state practices rather than immediate threats or political outcomes. It will help explain why states' employ seeming irrational and unproductive state practices as symbolic gestures designed to establish a single normative political order on populations. 4. The importance of the body and ethical practice in social movement research. My point in bringing in the body to the study of social movements and political sociology is to emphasize the historical situatedness of the political agent, in order to understand how social movements draw from political projects to produce normative ideas of political agents by training activists how to master bodily postures and
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
319
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
affective responses. I use ethics to refer to how political groups set limits within a political context of how one should act, via rhetoric and practice, which limits/defines/stabilizes a unitary political agent. Therefore, ethics ties together, through discourse, emotions and cognition through the body. It provides the link from how social movements use a political projects normative ideal to how they shape representations onto the populations they 'represent'. Subsequent research on social change and social movements that seeks to understand what changed and how it was changed would benefit by incorporating an approach that looks at the implicit normative ethical practices contained in movement pedagogy, narratives, and discourses, and how these ethical practices become part of a social movement's strategy.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
Thus, how social movements continue to make symbolic citizenship claims to secured rights and favorable legislation should become part of our understanding, and conceptual frameworks for studying, how groups fight inequality. While not all movements are able to induce state response, they will contribute to the arbitrary idea of what counts as idealized citizenship. Despite the loss of state sovereignty and the dissolution of national borders/boundaries, how social movements, ethno-religious and racial groups discipline and shape ethical practices to represent citizenship and in-group ideals will continue to important as they challenge what counts as membership and political inclusion. We should also be aware of the dangers in making such symbolic citizenship
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
320
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
claims. The normative claims split movements into two or more factions, and ultimately attach one set of ethical practices to the dominant representation of the group, while delegitimatizing and anchoring its opposite to the political margins. Drawing from the lessons and warnings that Deleuze and Guartti taught us in Anti-Oedipus, perhaps future social movement will develop bodily postures and affective practices to teach us how to master our desires for power, without subscribing to the need to purify ourselves racially, sexually, or class-wise, in order to organize a new set of leftist civic ethical practice.
&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;
