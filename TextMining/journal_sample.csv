0,1,1,"The Chinese citrus fly, <i>Bactrocera minax </i>(Enderlein), is a devastating citrus pest in Asia"
1,1,2," This univoltine insect enters obligatory pupal diapause in each generation, while little is known about the course and the molecular mechanisms of diapause"
2,1,3," In this study, the course of diapause was determined by measuring the respiratory rate throughout the pupal stage"
3,1,4," In addition, the variation of transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of pupae at five developmental stages (pre-, early-, middle-, late-, and post-diapause) were evaluated by next-generation sequencing technology and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), respectively"
4,1,5," A total of 4,808 genes were significantly altered in ten pairwise comparisons, representing major shifts in metabolism and signal transduction as well as endocrine system and digestive system"
5,1,6, Gene expression profiles were validated by qRT-PCR analysis
6,1,7," In addition, 48 metabolites were identified and quantified by 1H NMR"
7,1,8," Nine of which significantly contributed to the variation in the metabolomic profiles, especially proline and trehalose"
8,1,9," Moreover, the samples collected within diapause maintenance (early-, middle-, and late-diapause) only exhibited marginal transcriptomic and metabolomic variation with each other"
9,1,10, These findings greatly improve our understanding of <i>B
10,1,11, minax </i>diapause and lay the foundation for further pertinent studies
